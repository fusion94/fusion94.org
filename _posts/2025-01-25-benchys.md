## 3DBenchy Remix Takedowns Stir Controversy on Printables

Remixes of the iconic 3DBenchy model are being removed from
[Printables](https://printables.com), a 3D printing file-sharing platform
operated by [Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/). This enforcement
highlights longstanding but previously unenforced licensing restrictions tied to
the design.

The 3DBenchy, a popular benchmarking model for FDM 3D printers, has been
licensed under [Creative Commons BY-ND
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) since its release in 2015.
This license prohibits redistribution of derivative works. However, Creative
Tools, the model's creator, had not enforced these restrictions, allowing
remixed versions to circulate freely.

Concerns arose recently when Reddit user u/mkrjoe shared a Printables customer
support message stating all derivative Benchy models would be removed. The user
reported their remix, titled “My Benchy Glitched Out,” was deleted, sparking
widespread community backlash. Many makers expressed frustration in online
forums, criticizing the crackdown on reimagined versions of the beloved design.

The situation follows Creative Tools’ acquisition by NTI Group in March 2024.
This Denmark-based digital solutions provider now holds intellectual property
rights to 3DBenchy, fueling speculation that NTI initiated the takedowns.

However, NTI’s Chief Marketing Officer, Henriette Tamasauskas, denied this,
telling 3D Printing Industry that NTI “has not taken any action to enforce the
3DBenchy license or remove derivatives.” Prusa Research CMO Rudolf Krčmář
confirmed that Printables had acted in response to a “third-party report” but
clarified that NTI was not the source of the complaint.

Krčmář explained that Printables’ actions aligned with its policy of adhering to
licensing terms. “Standard procedure” required the removal of remixed Benchy
files due to the non-derivative clause of the BY-ND 4.0 license. He added that
discussions with NTI are ongoing, with both parties exploring options to address
the community’s concerns.

“NTI has expressed support for keeping remixes of the Benchy model available,”
Krčmář shared, suggesting that an amendment to the license could enable remixing
in the future. Tamasauskas emphasized NTI’s lack of intent to monetize 3DBenchy
and pledged to review potential solutions.

Meanwhile, Daniel Norée, 3DBenchy’s lead designer, bid farewell to Creative
Tools in a reflective [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282680313879683072/) following the company’s merger with NTI.
Describing Creative Tools as a once “great company,” Norée lamented its
dissolution and expressed gratitude for its role in the 3D printing community.

## Intellectual Property in the Maker Space

The 3DBenchy controversy underscores broader tensions between intellectual
property laws and the open-source ethos central to the maker community. While
Creative Commons licensing has facilitated the sharing of 3D-printable designs,
restrictive terms like the BY-ND 4.0 license challenge the free remix culture
embraced by many hobbyists.

Dr. Adrian Bowyer, founder of the RepRap project and a pioneer of open-source 3D
printing, has dismissed intellectual property protections as “nonsense upon
stilts.” Conversely, Michael Weinberg, a board member of the Open Source
Hardware Association (OSHWA), has praised Creative Commons licenses for enabling
a proliferation of publicly available 3D models.

Despite these benefits, licensing disputes in 3D printing are not new. In 2019,
Lego issued takedown notices targeting 3D-printed replicas of its products,
including fan art and scaled-up versions of iconic designs. Similarly, Honda
enforced intellectual property claims against Prusa Research in 2022, leading to
the removal of Honda-related files from Printables.

As the maker community grapples with the complexities of intellectual property,
the ongoing discussions between NTI and Prusa Research may offer a precedent for
balancing creativity, collaboration, and legal compliance in the future of 3D
printing.
