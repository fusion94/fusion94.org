## Wishful Thinking

Wishful thinking is the act of believing or hoping for something to be true,
often without regard to logic, evidence, or practicality. It involves imagining
a desired outcome, even if itâ€™s unrealistic or unlikely, because it aligns with
personal desires or fantasies. This type of thinking can lead people to make
decisions based on what they want to happen rather than what is actually
probable or reasonable.

For example, someone might hope for a promotion at work despite a lack of
qualifications, just because they want it to happen. Or someone might ignore
signs of an unhealthy relationship, believing it will improve on its own because
they deeply wish it will. While wishful thinking can offer comfort, it can also
lead to disappointment if it disconnects from reality.

Or as my grandfather used to say

> Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up first.
