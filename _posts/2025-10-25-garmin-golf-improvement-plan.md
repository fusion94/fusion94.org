# 🏌️‍♂️ 8-Week Garmin-Powered Golf Improvement Plan

## Overview

**Goal:** Lower your scoring average by 3–5 strokes and reduce variability
(especially big holes) through better data, smarter practice, and real-time
feedback.
**Tools:**

- **Garmin fēnix 8 Watch**
- **Garmin Approach CT10 Sensors**
- **Garmin Golf App**

**Focus Areas:**

1. Yardage control & consistency
2. Club selection accuracy
3. Fairway & green hit percentage
4. Distance control in wedges
5. On-course strategy & decision-making

---

## Week 1–2 → Baseline and Calibration

**Objective:** Establish your current performance profile.

### 🔧 Setup & Calibration

- Attach CT10 sensors to **7–10 clubs** (Driver, 5W, 7i, 9i, PW, SW, Putter, etc.).
- Pair all devices (watch + sensors + app).
- Verify course maps and PlaysLike data on your fēnix 8 are current.

### ⛳ Round Goals

- Play **2 rounds** on familiar courses.
- Don’t change anything about your game — play as usual.
- Upload rounds immediately to the Garmin Golf app.

### 📊 Data Review

Check:

- Average distance per club
- FIR (fairways hit %)
- GIR (greens in regulation %)
- Putts per round
- Miss tendencies (left/right, long/short)

**Deliverable:** Create a **baseline dashboard** — screenshot or export your
stats to compare later.

---

## Week 3–4 → Distance Control and Club Gapping

**Objective:** Calibrate your true distances and reduce mis-clubbed shots.

### 🧪 Range Practice

- Hit 10 shots with each club (Driver → Wedge).
- Use CT10 sensors to record carry vs total distance.
- Build a **personal distance chart** inside the Garmin Golf app.

### 🎯 On-Course Focus

- Play to your **average carry distance**, not your “best hit.”
- When in doubt, club up — trust your data.

### 📈 Metrics to Watch

- GIR %
- Short-side misses
- Club dispersion patterns

**Goal:** Reduce “short misses” by **30 %** by Week 4.

---

## Week 5–6 → Accuracy and Shot Shaping

**Objective:** Improve directional control and fairway accuracy.

### 🏌️ Range Work

- Alternate driver and long-iron practice with one chosen shape (fade or draw).
- Use fēnix 8 GPS or on-course practice for dispersion tracking.

### 🧠 Strategy Shift

- Use PlaysLike yardages on the fēnix 8 to choose smarter targets.
- Pre-shot question: “Where’s my miss?” → Aim accordingly.

### 💾 Data Review

Track:

- FIR % (driver accuracy)
- Approach miss direction
- Penalty strokes per round

**Goal:** Raise fairway hits from baseline by **10–15 %**.

---

## Week 7 → Scoring Zone — Wedges & Putting

**Objective:** Attack the short game with precision.

### 🧩 Wedge Calibration

- Hit 10 balls each from 50, 75, 100 yards.
- Record carry and rollout via CT10.
- Build a **wedge matrix** (e.g. ½ swing = 65 yds, ¾ swing = 85 yds).

### ⛳ Putting Focus

- Use the fēnix 8 to time your routine for consistency.
- Track putts and 3-putts per round in Garmin Golf.

**Goals:**

- Reduce 3-putts per round by **30 %**.
- Improve average proximity from 100 yds by **10 ft**.

---

## Week 8 → Review and Refine

**Objective:** Evaluate trends and plan your next cycle.

### 🧾 Data Review in Garmin Golf

Compare Week 8 vs Week 1–2 baseline:

- FIR %
- GIR %
- Putts per round
- Avg drive distance
- Miss patterns
- Scoring average

### 🧠 Insights

Ask:

- Which 2 areas improved most?
- Which still lag behind?
- What practice blocks were most effective?

### 🎯 New Targets

Set fresh 8-week goals in Garmin Golf:

- FIR 65 → 70 %
- GIR 55 → 65 %
- 3-putts 2.2 → 1.0
- Score avg 89 → 84

---

## 💡 Tips for Ongoing Success

- **Sync daily** to keep data fresh.
- **Tag practice sessions** so they feed your stats.
- **Use widgets** on fēnix 8 for shot history and performance summaries.
- **Re-evaluate every 8 weeks** for incremental gains.

---

## Optional Elite Add-Ons

- Add a **Garmin Approach R10** launch monitor for range feedback.
- Use **Garmin Coach / Connect** for fitness and mobility training.
- Pair HRV and sleep metrics from fēnix 8 to optimize recovery and tempo.

## Final Thoughts

The Garmin golf ecosystem is your **personal caddie, data analyst, and coach** in one.  
Using the fēnix 8 for real-time intelligence, the CT10 for shot tracking, and
the Garmin Golf app for analytics turns guesswork into evidence.

Eight weeks is enough to see real progress — but the true value is confidence:
knowing your game club by club, swing by swing.
