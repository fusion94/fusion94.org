# Background

My name is Tony Guntharp and I'm a fucking Texan. That's right I'm from the best place on planet earth, the great state of Texas.

I also make things. Software or Hardware, it doesn’t
matter. I’m OCD, a Geek, a Homebrewer. Fan of Open Source, Linux, OSX and
Mobile. Purveyor of Craft Beer and Single Malt Scotches. <del>Avid Motorcyclist
and Porsche 911 Owner</del>.

I spent 10 years of my life jumping out of airplanes for the US Army doing high
speed/low drag shit. Combat Veteran.

I'm also a conservationist and a hunter.

I was one of the Co-Founders of [SourceForge.net](http://sf.net).

I've been at [Apple](https://apple.com) since early 2020. I spent a year working
on making [Siri](http://apple.com/siri) more reliable but have since moved over
to [iCloud](http://apple.com/icloud) where I manage the SRE Team for
[Cloudkit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/). I also manage the remnants of the 
PIE-Solr team as well as the US Development teams for Pcl and i4c.

Prior to that I was at [Google](https://about.google/) for close to 6 years
where I worked as the [Site Reliability
Manager](https://landing.google.com/sre/) for the Carrier-SRE-MTV team. Most of
our focus was in the area of carrier related services including [Rich Communication Services
(RCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services), SMS
Aggregation and anything else related to mobile messaging.

I am (or was) a core developer/contributor for the following Open Source
Projects:

- [CLAHub](https://github.com/clahub)
- [OpenROV](https://github.com/openrov)
- [Kandan](https://github.com/kandanapp)
- [rIMS](https://github.com/DamageStudios/rims)
- [Titanium from Appcelerator](https://github.com/appcelerator/)

I’m an advisor/investor to the following projects:

- [Appgyver](https://www.appgyver.com/) Makers of Prototyper and Steroids
- [Flutter Wireless](http://flutterwireless.com/)

### Philosophy

I’m a big believer in [Open
Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services). As such
you’ll find quite a bit of of my work released under a variety of Open Source
licenses over at [GitHub](http://github.com).
