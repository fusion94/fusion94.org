## Introduction

I've been thinking about picking up some new 3d printers for awhile now as my
[FlashForge Creator
Pros](http://fusion94.org/2015/09/10/flashforge-creator-pro/) are starting to
show their age and one just doesn't print at all anymore.

Getting new printers (other than having a up-to-date platform) serves a few
purposes for me.

For one, Patrick is getting to the age (10) where he's spending a lot of time on
his smartphone and in games. I hope to use 3d Printing to teach him new skills,
empower his creativity, make family memories, and teach him a world of science
and design.

So I did a little bit of research and decided to go with a [Creality Ender 3 S1
Pro](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-s1-pro-fdm-3d-printer).

## Enter Creality

Overall, it's been a great printer with regards to ease of unboxing/installation
as well as the overall quality of the prints w/o any tuning whatsoever. It was
truly the easiest printer I've ever assembled. IIRC it was literally 11 bolts.
Dead Simple.

### Some of the key features are:

- Print size: 220 x 220 x 270 mm
- Up to 300°C high-temp printing
- Full-metal dual-gear direct extruder
- CR-touch automatic leveling
- 4.3″ display
- Easy to assemble

With regards to setup and tuning? Straight out of the box it's an amazing
printer. Here are a couple of shots of it as well as some of the initial prints:

Having said that, after doing some additional research I ended up reading a ton
of reviews and watching many, many YouTube videos about the Bambu X1-Carbon. Due
to some of these reviews I bit the bullet and pulled the trigger on one.

## Enter Bambu

I purchased a [Bambu X1-Carbon Combo](https://store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon-combo) on 7/17/2023 and it arrived via UPS on 7/20/2023. It sat in it's box for a few days until I could find time for the assembly. 

The printer is shipped in a pretty large cardboard box, with foam protection on the sides. The printer is packed well so I didn't expect any kind of damage during shipping. It can be easily taken out from the package by simply pulling from the sides of the plastic bag (But do take care here as plastic bags have a tendency to rip and tear).

While the printer comes pre-assembled (mostly); before you can start printing you will need to remove a few screws that hold some parts in place during shipping. If you purchased the AMS unit you will also need to remove it from the printer's enclosure via a few additional screws.

You will also need to attach the touchscreen to the printer via a supplied ribbon cable. 

Overall the assembly process took longer than the Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro but will still under an hour and signficantly easier that other printers that I've owned in the past.

### Some of the Key features and improvements:

- Large 256mm x 256mm x 256mm Build Volume
- Compatible Printing Materials Up to 300°C
- Built-In Camera Monitoring
- Compatible with Abrasive Filaments (NylonX, NylonG, etc.)
- Capable of Multi-Color and Multi-Material 3D Printing
  - Up to 16 colors printing
- High quality printing with 7 μm Lidar Resolution
- High speed CoreXY with 20000 mm/s² Acceleration
- Dual Auto Bed Leveling
- AI inspected first layer
- Spaghetti failure detection

## Final Thoughts

I can certainly state the experience now days is significantly better than when
I put my first 3D Printer together, a Prusa Mendel that is show below.

For reference that mendel was put together in 2011 and the printable parts were
printed using a Makerbot Cupcake CNC from 2009.

And now for some gratuitous photos of that Cupcake CNC
