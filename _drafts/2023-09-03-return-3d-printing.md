## Introduction

I've been thinking about picking up some new 3d printers for awhile now as my
[FlashForge Creator
Pros](http://fusion94.org/2015/09/10/flashforge-creator-pro/) are starting to
show their age and one just doesn't print at all anymore.

Getting new printers (other than having a up-to-date platform) serves a few
purposes for me.

For one, Patrick is getting to the age (10) where he's spending a lot of time on
his smartphone and in games. I hope to use 3d Printing to teach him new skills,
empower his creativity, make family memories, and teach him a world of science
and design.

So I did a little bit of research and decided to go with a [Creality Ender 3 S1
Pro](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-s1-pro-fdm-3d-printer).

## Enter Creality

Overall, it's been a great printer with regards to ease of unboxing/installation
as well as the overall quality of the prints w/o any tuning whatsoever. It was
truly the easiest printer I've ever assembled. IIRC it was literally 11 bolts.
Dead Simple.

### Some of the key features are:

- Print size: 220 x 220 x 270 mm
- Up to 300°C high-temp printing
- Full-metal dual-gear direct extruder
- CR-touch automatic leveling
- 4.3″ display
- Easy to assemble

With regards to setup and tuning? Straight out of the box it's an amazing
printer. Here are a couple of shots of it as well as some of the initial prints:

Having said that, after doing some additional research I ended up reading a ton
of reviews and watching many, many YouTube videos about the Bambu X1-Carbon. Due
to some of these reviews I bit the bullet and pulled the trigger on one.

## Final Thoughts

I can certainly state the experience now days is significantly better than when
I put my first 3D Printer together, a Prusa Mendel that is show below.

For reference that mendel was put together in 2011 and the printable parts were
printed using a Makerbot Cupcake CNC from 2009.

And now for some gratuitous photos of that Cupcake CNC
