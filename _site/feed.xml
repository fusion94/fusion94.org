        <title>The Remote Manager&apos;s Toolkit: Systems I Built for Leading Distributed SRE Teams</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Leading distributed SRE teams isn‚Äôt just about having the right video conferencing software. After a year of managing 40+ engineers across multiple time zones from my home office in Bandera, Texas, I‚Äôve built a comprehensive toolkit of systems that make remote leadership not just possible, but powerful. Here‚Äôs the practical playbook I wish I‚Äôd had when I started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-foundation-async-first-communication-architecture&quot;&gt;The Foundation: Async-First Communication Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake I see remote managers make is trying to recreate office dynamics online. Instead, I built an async-first communication system with clear escalation paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-communication-pyramid&quot;&gt;The Communication Pyramid&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-coderay&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CodeRay&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;üö® Emergency (PagerDuty/Phone): Production down, security incidents
üì± Urgent (Slack DM): Needs response within 2-4 hours
üí¨ Normal (Team Slack): 24-hour response expected
üìß FYI (Email/Docs): No response needed
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation tip&lt;/strong&gt;: We use Slack workflows to automatically categorize messages. Team members prefix messages with [URGENT], [FYI], or [DECISION-NEEDED] to set clear expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-1-the-digital-office-hours-framework&quot;&gt;System 1: The Digital Office Hours Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Apple, informal conversations happened naturally. Remotely, I had to engineer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-it-looks-like&quot;&gt;What It Looks Like:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday Morning Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;: 30-min optional video call, no agenda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;: 1-hour deep dive on a technical topic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday Wins&lt;/strong&gt;: 15-min team celebration of the week‚Äôs accomplishments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always-On Room&lt;/strong&gt;: A Zoom room that‚Äôs always open for drop-ins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;73% reduction in ‚Äúquick question‚Äù DMs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;45% increase in cross-team collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers report feeling more connected despite being distributed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-2-the-visibility-dashboard&quot;&gt;System 2: The Visibility Dashboard&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you can‚Äôt see your team, you need systems that create visibility without surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;our-stack&quot;&gt;Our Stack:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Datadog&lt;/strong&gt;: Real-time system health and SLO tracking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear&lt;/strong&gt;: Engineering project tracking with public roadmaps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confluence&lt;/strong&gt;: Async status updates and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Slack Bot&lt;/strong&gt;: Daily automated team check-ins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-daily-standup-bot&quot;&gt;The Daily Standup Bot:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-coderay&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CodeRay&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#777&quot;&gt;# Posts at 9 AM in each team member&apos;s local timezone&lt;/span&gt;
questions = [
    &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;What did you accomplish yesterday?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;What are you working on today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;Any blockers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;How are you feeling? (üü¢üü°üî¥)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#710&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emoji check-in has been surprisingly effective for catching early signs of burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-3-the-decision-making-framework&quot;&gt;System 3: The Decision-Making Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote teams can get stuck in endless Slack threads. I implemented RAPID decision-making with a twist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt; posted in dedicated Slack channel with:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Problem statement&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Proposed solution&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;RAPID roles assigned&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Decision deadline&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt; happens async in threads&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision&lt;/strong&gt; recorded in our decision log with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What we decided&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Why we decided it&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Who was involved&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When we‚Äôll revisit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;template-example&quot;&gt;Template Example:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-markdown highlighter-coderay&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CodeRay&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;## Decision: Migration to Kubernetes

**Recommend**: Platform Team
**Approve**: Engineering Director
**Perform**: SRE Team
**Input**: Security, Network Teams
**Decide**: VP of Engineering
**Deadline**: Friday, 5 PM CT
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-4-the-performance-management-system&quot;&gt;System 4: The Performance Management System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional performance management assumes you can observe people working. My system focuses on outcomes and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;quarterly-components&quot;&gt;Quarterly Components:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Assessment&lt;/strong&gt; (What went well/poorly/learned)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; (360-degree via Culture Amp)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics Review&lt;/strong&gt; (Deployment frequency, MTTR, SLO achievement)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Planning&lt;/strong&gt; (Skills matrix + learning goals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-11-framework&quot;&gt;The 1:1 Framework:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-coderay&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CodeRay&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Week 1: Career development focus
Week 2: Project/tactical focus
Week 3: Skip-level with my manager
Week 4: Team dynamics and culture
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-5-the-knowledge-management-system&quot;&gt;System 5: The Knowledge Management System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation is the lifeblood of distributed teams. We treat it like code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;our-approach&quot;&gt;Our Approach:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docs as Code&lt;/strong&gt;: All documentation in Git with PR reviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templates for Everything&lt;/strong&gt;: Runbooks, postmortems, project specs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Library&lt;/strong&gt;: Record important meetings and decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search-First Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Everything tagged and indexed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-runbook-standard&quot;&gt;The Runbook Standard:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-coderay&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CodeRay&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#606&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;Service Name Runbook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#606&quot;&gt;owners&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;[team-name]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#606&quot;&gt;last-reviewed&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;2025-07-15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#606&quot;&gt;slo&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;99.9%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#606&quot;&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;:
  - &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;architecture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  - &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;common-issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  - &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;escalation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  - &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#D20&quot;&gt;monitoring-links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-6-the-culture-building-toolkit&quot;&gt;System 6: The Culture Building Toolkit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture doesn‚Äôt happen by accident in remote teams. It needs systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-works&quot;&gt;What Works:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Coffee Roulette&lt;/strong&gt;: Bot randomly pairs people for 15-min chats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show and Tell Fridays&lt;/strong&gt;: Engineers demo personal projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Team Retreats&lt;/strong&gt;: Quarterly in-person gatherings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack Celebrations&lt;/strong&gt;: #kudos channel with monthly recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-doesnt&quot;&gt;What Doesn‚Äôt:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mandatory virtual happy hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zoom backgrounds as ‚Äúteam building‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trust falls over video calls (yes, someone suggested this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-7-the-incident-management-evolution&quot;&gt;System 7: The Incident Management Evolution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote incident management requires different muscle memory than huddling in a war room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;our-setup&quot;&gt;Our Setup:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedicated Incident Slack Channels&lt;/strong&gt;: Auto-created by PagerDuty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;: Always use video during incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Roles&lt;/strong&gt;: IC, Scribe, Comms, Tech Lead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-the-Sun&lt;/strong&gt;: Handoffs across time zones with detailed context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-handoff-template&quot;&gt;The Handoff Template:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-coderay&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CodeRay&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Current State: [System status]
What We Know: [Root cause hypothesis]
What We&apos;ve Tried: [Actions taken]
Next Steps: [Planned actions]
Who&apos;s On Point: [Name + contact]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-8-the-onboarding-machine&quot;&gt;System 8: The Onboarding Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New team members can‚Äôt learn by osmosis. They need structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;week-1-4-checklist&quot;&gt;Week 1-4 Checklist:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Tech stack setup + architecture overview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Shadow on-call + first PR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Own first small project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Present learnings to team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-buddy-system&quot;&gt;The Buddy System:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each new hire gets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onboarding buddy (peer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical mentor (senior engineer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Culture guide (team lead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tools-that-actually-matter&quot;&gt;Tools That Actually Matter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After testing dozens of tools, here‚Äôs what stuck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;essential&quot;&gt;Essential:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;: Async communication hub&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;: Video calls with good recording&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miro&lt;/strong&gt;: Virtual whiteboarding that actually works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendly&lt;/strong&gt;: Solving the timezone puzzle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loom&lt;/strong&gt;: Quick video explanations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;nice-to-have&quot;&gt;Nice to Have:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donut&lt;/strong&gt;: Automated coffee chat pairings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clockwise&lt;/strong&gt;: Calendar optimization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Otter.ai&lt;/strong&gt;: Meeting transcriptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gathered&lt;/strong&gt;: Virtual office space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;metrics-that-matter&quot;&gt;Metrics That Matter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if your remote systems are working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-i-track&quot;&gt;What I Track:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response Time&lt;/strong&gt;: How quickly do people get unblocked?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Health&lt;/strong&gt;: % of meetings with clear outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;: % of systems with current runbooks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team NPS&lt;/strong&gt;: Monthly pulse surveys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivery Velocity&lt;/strong&gt;: Features shipped per sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;red-flags&quot;&gt;Red Flags:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing after-hours Slack messages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declining participation in optional meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growing backlog of decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced cross-team collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mindset-shifts&quot;&gt;The Mindset Shifts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools are just the beginning. Leading remote teams requires fundamental mindset shifts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Presence to Output&lt;/strong&gt;: Judge performance by results, not hours online&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Sync to Async&lt;/strong&gt;: Default to async unless real-time is essential&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Control to Trust&lt;/strong&gt;: Give autonomy and expect accountability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Implicit to Explicit&lt;/strong&gt;: Document everything, assume nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-from-the-ranch&quot;&gt;Lessons from the Ranch&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from rural Texas has taught me that constraints breed creativity. Limited internet bandwidth forced us to optimize our tools. The 2-hour time difference from the West Coast made us better at async communication. Even the occasional tractor driving by during calls reminds everyone that great engineering can happen anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs Next&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote work isn‚Äôt a temporary solution‚Äîit‚Äôs the future of engineering teams. The systems I‚Äôve built aren‚Äôt perfect, but they‚Äôve transformed a traditionally on-site organization into a high-performing distributed engineering culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to be intentional. Every process, every tool, every meeting needs to justify its existence in a remote context. If it doesn‚Äôt make distributed teams more effective, it doesn‚Äôt belong in your toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I continue to refine these systems from my home office, watching the Texas sun set over the hills, I‚Äôm reminded that the best engineering happens when we remove barriers, not when we add them. Geography is just another barrier we‚Äôve learned to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What systems have you built for remote engineering leadership? What‚Äôs worked and what hasn‚Äôt? Share your toolkit in the comments‚Äîwe‚Äôre all learning together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Apple Park to Remote Ranch: Lessons in Engineering Leadership Transformation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been just over a year since I left Apple and joined GEICO, trading the gleaming corridors of Apple Park for my home office overlooking the Texas Hill Country. The contrast couldn‚Äôt be more stark ‚Äì from one of the world‚Äôs most famous corporate campuses to leading teams from my ranch in Bandera. Yet, this transition has taught me invaluable lessons about modern engineering leadership, organizational transformation, and the future of distributed work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-apple-park-experience&quot;&gt;The Apple Park Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that Apple Park is everything you‚Äôve heard and more. The attention to detail, the collaborative spaces, the famous rainbow stairs at Caff√® Macs ‚Äì it all contributes to a unique culture of innovation. Leading SRE teams for iCloud and CloudKit meant daily stand-ups in beautifully designed conference rooms, impromptu whiteboard sessions in the hallways, and the energy that comes from being physically present with brilliant engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Apple, proximity was power. Quick decisions happened over coffee. Complex architectural discussions unfolded naturally as you walked between buildings. The campus itself was designed to foster these ‚Äúcollisions‚Äù ‚Äì those serendipitous encounters that spark innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-remote-reality-check&quot;&gt;The Remote Reality Check&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined GEICO in late 2023, I found myself in a completely different world. Not just because I was working from home, but because I was tasked with transforming a traditional IT organization into a modern engineering culture ‚Äì all while leading distributed teams across multiple time zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few weeks were jarring. No more walking to someone‚Äôs desk for a quick chat. No more reading body language in a room full of engineers. Instead, I had Slack messages, Zoom calls, and the occasional ‚ÄúCan you hear me?‚Äù interrupting critical discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here‚Äôs what I discovered: the constraints of remote work can actually2 accelerate cultural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-trust-at-distance&quot;&gt;Building Trust at Distance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Apple, trust was built through presence. You earned credibility by being in the room, contributing to discussions, and demonstrating your expertise in real-time. In a distributed environment, trust must be engineered differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-communicate intentionally&lt;/strong&gt;: Every decision, every change in direction, every win needed to be documented and shared broadly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create virtual ‚Äúwater cooler‚Äù moments&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular optional video calls with no agenda, just for team members to connect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish clear async communication protocols&lt;/strong&gt;: When to use Slack vs. email vs. picking up the phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure outcomes, not hours&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifting focus from time in seat to actual impact delivered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transforming-it-culture-from-1500-miles-away&quot;&gt;Transforming IT Culture from 1,500 Miles Away&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest challenge has been leading GEICO‚Äôs transformation from a traditional IT organization to an engineering-focused culture. At Apple, the engineering mindset was baked into the company‚Äôs DNA. At GEICO, we‚Äôre actively rewiring that DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation requires:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;1-shifting-from-tickets-to-products&quot;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Shifting from Tickets to Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional IT thinks in tickets and requests. Engineering thinks in products and user outcomes. We‚Äôve restructured teams around products rather than technologies, giving them ownership of entire user journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-embracing-failure-as-learning&quot;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Embracing Failure as Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional IT, failure is to be avoided at all costs. In engineering, failure is data. We‚Äôve implemented blameless postmortems and celebration of lessons learned, even when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;3-automation-first-mindset&quot;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Automation First Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving from manual processes to ‚Äúautomate everything‚Äù requires not just new tools, but a fundamental shift in how people think about their work. We‚Äôve made automation a key metric for team success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;4-from-gatekeepers-to-enablers&quot;&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;From Gatekeepers to Enablers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional IT often sees itself as the guardian of stability. We‚Äôre transforming our teams to be enablers of innovation, providing platforms and tools that let other engineers move faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hybrid-cloud-sre-challenge&quot;&gt;The Hybrid Cloud SRE Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading Hybrid Cloud SRE at GEICO means bridging on-premises infrastructure with cloud-native thinking. Unlike Apple, where the infrastructure was largely homogeneous and cutting-edge, GEICO has decades of legacy systems that still run critical business functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote leadership has actually been an advantage here. It‚Äôs forced us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document everything meticulously&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build robust monitoring and observability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create self-service platforms that don‚Äôt require hand-holding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish clear SLIs/SLOs that everyone can rally around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year of this transition, here are my key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;1-geography-is-irrelevant-time-zones-matter&quot;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Geography is Irrelevant, Time Zones Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can lead teams effectively from my ranch in Texas. But coordinating across time zones requires intentional planning and respect for work-life boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-culture-change-happens-through-systems&quot;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Culture Change Happens Through Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can‚Äôt transform culture through proximity and osmosis in a remote environment. You need systems, processes, and metrics that reinforce the behaviors you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;3-written-communication-is-a-superpower&quot;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Written Communication is a Superpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Apple, you could get by with great verbal communication. In distributed teams, the ability to write clearly and concisely is non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;4-autonomy-accelerates-innovation&quot;&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Autonomy Accelerates Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote teams with clear goals and autonomy move faster than co-located teams waiting for approval. The key is setting the right constraints and letting teams run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;5-the-ranch-office-advantage&quot;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;The Ranch Office Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs something to be said for taking a critical infrastructure call while watching deer graze outside your window. The ability to step outside, clear your head, and return with fresh perspective is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of engineering leadership isn‚Äôt about choosing between Apple Park and the remote ranch. It‚Äôs about taking the best of both worlds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The innovation culture and attention to excellence from places like Apple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The flexibility and global talent access of distributed teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The focus on outcomes over presence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to transform organizations by changing systems, not just proximity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this from my home office in Bandera, with my 3D printers humming in the workshop next door and my dogs napping at my feet, I‚Äôm convinced that the future of engineering leadership is distributed, asynchronous, and focused on outcomes rather than offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from Apple Park to my remote ranch hasn‚Äôt been about giving something up. It‚Äôs been about gaining new perspectives on what engineering leadership can be when you strip away the beautiful buildings and focus on what really matters: building great teams that deliver exceptional results, regardless of where they happen to be sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What‚Äôs your experience with remote engineering leadership? Have you made a similar transition? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Benchy&apos;s Gone Wild</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;3dbenchy-remix-takedowns-stir-controversy-on-printables&quot;&gt;3DBenchy Remix Takedowns Stir Controversy on Printables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remixes of the iconic 3DBenchy model are being removed from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://printables.com&quot;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt;, a 3D printing file-sharing platform
operated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prusa3d.com/&quot;&gt;Prusa Research&lt;/a&gt;. This enforcement
highlights longstanding but previously unenforced licensing restrictions tied to
the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3DBenchy, a popular benchmarking model for FDM 3D printers, has been
licensed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons BY-ND
4.0&lt;/a&gt; since its release in 2015.
This license prohibits redistribution of derivative works. However, Creative
Tools, the model‚Äôs creator, had not enforced these restrictions, allowing
remixed versions to circulate freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns arose recently when Reddit user u/mkrjoe shared a Printables customer
support message stating all derivative Benchy models would be removed. The user
reported their remix, titled ‚ÄúMy Benchy Glitched Out,‚Äù was deleted, sparking
widespread community backlash. Many makers expressed frustration in online
forums, criticizing the crackdown on reimagined versions of the beloved design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation follows Creative Tools‚Äô acquisition by NTI Group in March 2024.
This Denmark-based digital solutions provider now holds intellectual property
rights to 3DBenchy, fueling speculation that NTI initiated the takedowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, NTI‚Äôs Chief Marketing Officer, Henriette Tamasauskas, denied this,
telling 3D Printing Industry that NTI ‚Äúhas not taken any action to enforce the
3DBenchy license or remove derivatives.‚Äù Prusa Research CMO Rudolf Krƒçm√°≈ô
confirmed that Printables had acted in response to a ‚Äúthird-party report‚Äù but
clarified that NTI was not the source of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krƒçm√°≈ô explained that Printables‚Äô actions aligned with its policy of adhering to
licensing terms. ‚ÄúStandard procedure‚Äù required the removal of remixed Benchy
files due to the non-derivative clause of the BY-ND 4.0 license. He added that
discussions with NTI are ongoing, with both parties exploring options to address
the community‚Äôs concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúNTI has expressed support for keeping remixes of the Benchy model available,‚Äù
Krƒçm√°≈ô shared, suggesting that an amendment to the license could enable remixing
in the future. Tamasauskas emphasized NTI‚Äôs lack of intent to monetize 3DBenchy
and pledged to review potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Daniel Nor√©e, 3DBenchy‚Äôs lead designer, bid farewell to Creative
Tools in a reflective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282680313879683072/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; following the company‚Äôs merger with NTI.
Describing Creative Tools as a once ‚Äúgreat company,‚Äù Nor√©e lamented its
dissolution and expressed gratitude for its role in the 3D printing community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intellectual-property-in-the-maker-space&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property in the Maker Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3DBenchy controversy underscores broader tensions between intellectual
property laws and the open-source ethos central to the maker community. While
Creative Commons licensing has facilitated the sharing of 3D-printable designs,
restrictive terms like the BY-ND 4.0 license challenge the free remix culture
embraced by many hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adrian Bowyer, founder of the RepRap project and a pioneer of open-source 3D
printing, has dismissed intellectual property protections as ‚Äúnonsense upon
stilts.‚Äù Conversely, Michael Weinberg, a board member of the Open Source
Hardware Association (OSHWA), has praised Creative Commons licenses for enabling
a proliferation of publicly available 3D models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these benefits, licensing disputes in 3D printing are not new. In 2019,
Lego issued takedown notices targeting 3D-printed replicas of its products,
including fan art and scaled-up versions of iconic designs. Similarly, Honda
enforced intellectual property claims against Prusa Research in 2022, leading to
the removal of Honda-related files from Printables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the maker community grapples with the complexities of intellectual property,
the ongoing discussions between NTI and Prusa Research may offer a precedent for
balancing creativity, collaboration, and legal compliance in the future of 3D
printing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AMS Humidity Control</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;bambu-labs-automatic-material-system-and-the-importance-of-humidity-control&quot;&gt;Bambu Lab‚Äôs Automatic Material System and the Importance of Humidity Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bambu Lab Automatic Material System (AMS) revolutionizes 3D printing by
streamlining filament management for multi-material and multi-color projects.
Designed to work seamlessly with Bambu Lab‚Äôs advanced 3D printers, the AMS
automates filament swapping and ensures precise material handling, eliminating
manual intervention during complex prints. With its smart storage and
compatibility with various filament types, it enhances productivity and reduces
the risk of errors, making it an essential tool for professionals and hobbyists
alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature of the AMS is its focus on humidity control, a critical factor in
maintaining filament quality. It does this by utilizing an air-tight seal and
with the help of dessicant material, it absorbs moisture to keep the moisture
away from filament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Humidity Sensor also detects the humidity inside the AMS and provides
information to the user when the humidity is higher or the dessicant may need to
be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/3d-printing/ams-inside.png&quot; alt=&quot;AMS Insides&quot; title=&quot;AMS Insides&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-minimize-humidity&quot;&gt;Why Minimize Humidity?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humidity can wreak havoc on filament properties. When filaments absorb moisture,
several issues can arise during printing. Moisture-laden filaments can lead to
poor adhesion between layers, causing warping or misshaping of the final print.
Additionally, when moisture in the filament is heated during the printing
process, it turns into steam, creating tiny bubbles or voids in the extruded
material, which severely affects the strength and aesthetics of the print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-science-behind-humidity-impact&quot;&gt;The Science Behind Humidity Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a microscopic level, moisture impacts the filament‚Äôs viscosity during the
melting process. This alteration can lead to inconsistent extrusion rates, which
are critical for precision in 3D printing. Filaments like PLA, PETG, and especially
hygroscopic materials like Nylon or TPU can absorb moisture from the air,
leading to compromised prints, such as stringing, bubbling, or weak layer
adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improvements&quot;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the AMS system performs well in maintaining a consistent and steady
humidity level, there is still room for improvement to optimize its performance.
While it effectively handles standard conditions, certain scenarios or
environmental factors may expose limitations in its ability to maintain ideal
humidity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant issues I‚Äôve noticed is that the desiccant used (and
sold by Bambu) isn‚Äôt rechargeable. To be frank, it‚Äôs not particularly effective
either. Each AMS unit relies on two desiccant packs, which, in my experience,
only last about a month‚Äîeven in a relatively dry environment. And did I mention
they‚Äôre not rechargeable? This is because the desiccant is made from calcium
chloride (&lt;strong&gt;CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), which inherently lacks the ability to be
regenerated for repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Calcium chloride is an inorganic compound ‚Äì a salt with the chemical formula
CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is white flakes or pellets at room temperature, and is highly
soluble in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://makerworld.com/en/models/158496#profileId-173988&quot;&gt;AMS DryPods&lt;/a&gt;
designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://makerworld.com/en/@mcmaven&quot;&gt;mcmaven&lt;/a&gt;. With over 28k
downloads it‚Äôs one of the best solutions out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are DryPods you might be asking? DryPods are compact desiccant packs
designed to absorb moisture and reduce humidity in enclosed spaces. DryPods
typically contain a hygroscopic material, such as silica gel or calcium
chloride, which attracts and traps moisture from the air. Depending on their
design, some DryPods are reusable and can be recharged by heating to expel
absorbed moisture, while others are single-use and need replacement after
becoming saturated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These DryPods are 3d printable and contain printable desiccant trays as well as
desiccant containers that slide inbetween the first stage feeder motors. The
containers come in several variations to include Wide DryPod options that can
hold hygrometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Bambu or compatible Round Hygrometer with vertical or 30 degree tabs,
with a hole all the way through it, which should generate more accurate
measurements. A 42mm diameter x 14mm deep body and a 46mm diameter bezel is
supported. (Default on Plate 1.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Bambu or compatible Round Hygrometer with a shallow hole for the
hygrometer, which allows the DryPod hold more desiccant, but may be less
accurate in measuring the overall humidity level of the AMS. A 42mm diameter x
14mm deep body and a 46mm diameter bezel is supported. (Floating).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the Bambu Rectangular Hygrometer.  A 45x26x15mm body and a 48x29mm bezel
is supported. (Floating).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the Xiaomi Bluetooth Thermometer Hygrometer. A 43x43x12.5 mm body is
supported.(Floating).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of a hygrometer in the AMS DryPods setup allows for real-time
monitoring of the humidity levels. This precision ensures that the environment
within the DryPod remains at an ideal humidity level, often recommended to be
below 15% for most materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also smaller containers (narrower) that can be slotted on the outside
of the feeder motors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With fresh desiccant, the humidity dropped to 10% (Level 1) within a few hours
and remained as low as 20% (Level 2) even after six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stefan from CNC Kitchen has created an excellent and detailed video exploring
the different types of desiccants, their pros and cons, and various methods for
drying them. While he focuses heavily on filament bags, the drying techniques he
explains are equally applicable to loose desiccant. It‚Äôs an insightful resource
for anyone looking to optimize moisture control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of systems like the Bambu Lab AMS with advanced humidity
controls such as DryPods using rechargeable desiccant highlights the growing
sophistication of 3D printing technology. By tackling the critical issue of
humidity‚Äôs impact on filaments, Bambu Lab is setting a new standard for
reliability and efficiency in 3D printing. These innovations empower both
enthusiasts and professionals to achieve higher-quality results with greater
consistency. As the industry continues to evolve, systems like these are likely
to become essential tools in the world of additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fitness Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-year-in-review-my-2024-fitness-journey-and-goals-for-2025&quot;&gt;A Year in Review: My 2024 Fitness Journey and Goals for 2025&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024 has been a transformative year for my fitness journey. Embracing a
healthier lifestyle, I managed to shed an incredible 34 pounds‚Äîa milestone that
has significantly improved both my physical health and mental well-being. This
achievement was fueled by a combination of disciplined eating habits, regular
exercise routines, and an unwavering commitment to my goals. Reflecting on this
journey, I‚Äôm not just proud of the weight I‚Äôve lost but also the strength and
endurance I‚Äôve gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/weight-loss.png&quot; alt=&quot;Weight Loss Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we step into 2025, I‚Äôm eager to build on this foundation with new challenges
and ambitions. My goal for this year is to lose an additional 20 pounds. This
target is not just about reducing the number on the scale but also about
refining and optimizing my diet and fitness regimen to maintain sustainable
health benefits. I plan to incorporate more plant-based meals into my diet and
increase my daily physical activity by introducing more consistent cardio
sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, 2025 will be the year I venture into weight lifting. I aim to develop
a structured strength training program that will not only aid in weight loss but
also build muscle mass and enhance overall body composition. This new focus on
lifting weights will be crucial for improving my bone density, boosting
metabolism, and increasing muscle strength‚Äîall essential components of a
holistic approach to health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embarking on this dual journey of weight loss and strength training is both
exciting and daunting. However, the success of the past year provides a solid
blueprint for what dedication and perseverance can achieve. I look forward to
sharing my experiences, the challenges I face, and the milestones I reach.
Here‚Äôs to a healthier, stronger 2025!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;surpassing-goals-and-setting-new-horizons-my-reading-journey-from-2024-to-2025&quot;&gt;Surpassing Goals and Setting New Horizons: My Reading Journey from 2024 to 2025&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we welcome the new year, it‚Äôs a perfect time to reflect on our
accomplishments and set new targets. In 2024, I set a modest goal for myself to
read 16 books. Reading has always been a way for me to unwind and learn, but
last year, it became more than just a hobby‚Äîit became a journey of discovery and
achievement. To my own surprise, I didn‚Äôt just meet my goal; I soared past it,
finishing 23 books and covering a whopping 8,037 pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience was illuminating in several ways. Not only did it reaffirm my
love for reading, but it also pushed me to explore genres and authors I might
not have considered before. The books ranged from technical tomes that enhanced
my professional skills to imaginative works of fiction that transported me to
different worlds. Each page turned added a new layer to my understanding and
appreciation of the written word, making the year both enriching and
intellectually satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by last year‚Äôs success, I‚Äôve decided to ambitiously set my 2025 reading
goal at 30 books. This new target is not just about quantity, but also about
continuing to diversify the types of books I engage with. I plan to delve deeper
into non-fiction, exploring topics in history and science, while still enjoying
the fictional realms of fantasy and mystery that I love so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching this goal will undoubtedly require discipline and dedication,
especially with a busy schedule. However, the joy and knowledge gained from each
book make every minute spent reading worthwhile. I‚Äôm excited about the
challenges and discoveries that lie ahead in my 2025 reading adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those looking to embark on their own reading journey, or anyone seeking to
surpass their previous achievements, let‚Äôs remind ourselves that goals are not
just endpoints but stepping stones to greater achievements. Here‚Äôs to a year
filled with wonderful reads and inspiring stories!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wishful Thinking</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;wishful-thinking&quot;&gt;Wishful Thinking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishful thinking is the act of believing or hoping for something to be true,
often without regard to logic, evidence, or practicality. It involves imagining
a desired outcome, even if it‚Äôs unrealistic or unlikely, because it aligns with
personal desires or fantasies. This type of thinking can lead people to make
decisions based on what they want to happen rather than what is actually
probable or reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, someone might hope for a promotion at work despite a lack of
qualifications, just because they want it to happen. Or someone might ignore
signs of an unhealthy relationship, believing it will improve on its own because
they deeply wish it will. While wishful thinking can offer comfort, it can also
lead to disappointment if it disconnects from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or as my grandfather used to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>My Gaming History - Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-891097p1.html&quot;&gt;karnoff&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shutterstock.com/&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been gaming for what seems like forever and to be honest, compared to most
of you I have been. This is a brief history of my love affair with gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-early-days&quot;&gt;The Early Days&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Atari released the Atari VCS (later known as the Atari 2600).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was released, the Atari VCS was only designed to play 10 simple
challenge games. However, the console included an external ROM slot where game
cartridges could be plugged in; the potential was quickly discovered by
programmers around the world, who created games far outperforming the console‚Äôs
original designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original list of games:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Air-Sea Battle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic Math&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blackjack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indy 500&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Ship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Street Racer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surround&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video Olympics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of the microprocessor also led to the release of Space Invaders
for the Atari VCS in 1980, signifying a new era of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/gaming/Atari-2600.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atari 2600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Atari 2600&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an Atari 2600 sometime right around christmas of 1980 and grew to love the
like Asteroids, Pitfall, Frogger, Pong, Space Invaders and of course Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;pc-gaming---the-start&quot;&gt;PC Gaming - The Start&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980 I was in sixth grade and attending Lakewood Elementary School in Euless
Texas. I got accepted into their ‚ÄúTalented and Gifted Program‚Äù and started
taking programming classes on the TRS 80 using Level III BASIC (Beginners‚Äô
All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) developed by Microsoft. All our
development at that time was done using audio cassette drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I had been playing quite a bit of Adventure and the fact that the TRS 80
had at best rudimentary graphics I started learning how to program ‚ÄúAdventure‚Äù
style games on those TRS 80‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That really was my first adventure into both programming and PC Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;pc-gaming---the-next-phase&quot;&gt;PC Gaming - The Next Phase&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to play around with programming computers all through High School
and then ended up in the Military for a few years. While in the military I
continued to play games mostly on a Commodore 64 System although I also played
around on the IBM XT (8088 based), the IBM Personal Computer/AT (80286 based)
and the XT 286 (also 80286 based).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I left Active Duty Military in 1991 I ended up purchasing a Intel 386 based
system which was a 32-bit microprocessor first introduced in 1985 but not really
affordable until a few years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that he first real commercial games became available via BBS
and were considered shareware. The majority of these games came from iD Software
and included the following titles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons (released on December 14, 1990)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wolfenstein 3D (released on May 5, 1992)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doom (released on December 10, 1993)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993/1994 I got my first Intel 486 based system and moved to Silicon Valley
to begin working professionally as a Software Engineer and continued to play
video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;pc-gaming---mmo-phase&quot;&gt;PC Gaming - MMO Phase&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to play most of these games when I first moved to California and in
1997 I found Massively Multiplayer Online Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG or more commonly MMO) is an online
video game with a large numbers of players, often hundreds or thousands, on
the same server. MMOs usually feature a huge, persistent open world, although
there are games that differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of MMO‚Äôs that I started playing in order are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ultima Online (released on September 24, 1997)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everquest (released on March 16, 1999)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asheron‚Äôs Call (released on November 2, 1999)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anarchy Online (released on June 27, 2001)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asheron‚Äôs Call 2 (released on November 22, 2002)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eve Online (released on May 6, 2003)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;World of Worldcraft (released on November 23, 2004)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working in Silicon Valley for a few years, and at this point, I had
co-founded the Open Source web site &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.net&quot;&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; and then got laid
off from VA Software. At the time I got laid off I received a really good
package and was spending a lot of my time mostly playing Asheron‚Äôs Call and
Anarchy Online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, I had stayed up all night playing both of those games when
the first events of September 11th 2001 occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months after the events of 9/11 I ended up started a game development
studio called Damage Studios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in San Francisco, California, Damage Studios is developing
Rekonstruction as a persistent online title where a futuristic Earth must be
rebuilt following a devastating asteroid collision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;to-be-continued&quot;&gt;To be continued&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that‚Äôs the end of Part -1. I will be continuing the story about Damage
Studios and Rekonstruction in a future post (Part 2) and then conclude my gaming
journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Job, New Location</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;exiting-apple&quot;&gt;Exiting Apple&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working at Apple is often seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry‚Äîa
place where innovation thrives and the brightest minds collaborate to create
world-changing products. However, beneath the surface of this high-performance
environment lies a culture that can be toxic and stifling, marked by intense
micromanagement and an overwhelming pressure to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for perfection at Apple is relentless. While this has led to some of
the most iconic products in the world, it also creates an atmosphere where
employees often feel they are constantly walking on eggshells. Decisions are
scrutinized at every level, and the need for approval from multiple layers of
management can slow down even the simplest of tasks. This culture of
micromanagement not only hinders creativity but also breeds a sense of distrust,
where employees may hesitate to take initiative or think outside the box for
fear of being second-guessed or reprimanded.\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toxicity in this environment often stems from the intense pressure to deliver
results, which can lead to a work culture that values output over well-being.
The expectation to be ‚Äúalways on‚Äù creates a cycle of burnout that is difficult
to break. Employees may find themselves working long hours, sacrificing personal
time, and constantly pushing beyond their limits, all while receiving little
recognition or support. This not only affects morale but also takes a toll on
mental health, creating an unsustainable work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the experience at Apple is a double-edged sword. The
brand‚Äôs prestige and the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects are
undeniable draws. However, it‚Äôs essential to acknowledge the less glamorous side
of the company culture‚Äîa side that can be draining and demoralizing, even for
the most passionate and dedicated professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, after almost 4 years at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the spaceship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and working
with some amazing people (some not &lt;em&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt;), I made decision back in October to
leave Apple and look for someting else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-beginnings&quot;&gt;New Beginnings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up taking a position at the first company I interviewed with. Most of
the reasons are listed below but what isn‚Äôt mentioned below was the opportunity
to work with some other ex-Apple folks that I respected a great deal as well as
the job being full remote. Not some bullshit RTO Mandate that involved
commuting to Apple Park to manage a team that wasn‚Äôt in fact local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining GEICO as the Senior Director of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud SRE is an
exciting new chapter in my career, one that comes at a pivotal moment for the
company. GEICO is undergoing a significant transformation, shifting from a
traditional IT organization to a forward-thinking Engineering organization. This
transition is more than just a change in titles or processes‚Äîit‚Äôs a fundamental
reimagining of how we approach technology, problem-solving, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, IT organizations have often been seen as reactive, primarily
focused on maintaining systems and responding to issues as they arise. But as
the landscape of technology evolves, so too must our approach. At GEICO, we are
moving towards a model where engineering principles drive our decisions and
strategies. This shift means embracing a culture of continuous improvement,
automation, and resilience. It‚Äôs about empowering teams to build, innovate, and
take ownership of their work, rather than just maintaining what already exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we transition to this new model, my role in Hybrid Cloud SRE will be crucial.
We‚Äôre focusing on building robust, scalable, and highly available cloud
environments that support our engineering teams and drive business outcomes.
This involves not just adopting new technologies, but also fostering a mindset
where reliability, automation, and proactive problem-solving are at the core of
everything we do. It‚Äôs an exciting time to be at GEICO, and I‚Äôm eager to
contribute to this transformation, helping to lead our teams into a future where
engineering excellence is the norm, not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey ahead will undoubtedly come with its challenges, but it‚Äôs these
challenges that make the transformation so rewarding. I‚Äôm looking forward to
collaborating with talented professionals across the company, leveraging our
collective expertise to build something truly remarkable. This is more than just
a job‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to be part of a movement that will redefine how GEICO
approaches technology and engineering in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-more-thing&quot;&gt;One More Thing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Steve Jobs‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since the GEICO position was full remote and since we were looking for a
place to retire we ended up purchasing a house in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandera,_Texas&quot;&gt;Bandera
TX&lt;/a&gt;. While it‚Äôs a pretty small
town (under 900 people or so) and pretty remote we‚Äôre still only 25 minutes away
from Boerne and 40 minutes away from San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonus is we were able to get a house with a huge workshop for me and my
projects and the local electric co-operative also provided a 2gig fiber link to
the house (take that Silicon Valley). While we‚Äôre not selling the house in Half
Moon Bay anytime soon we are splitting time between the two houses (mostly
Nicole and Patrick in CA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well thanks for taking the time to read and here‚Äôs some gratuitious photos:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I&apos;m back</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Returning to the world of blogging after nearly four years at Apple feels like
rediscovering an old friend. The time away has been transformative, filled with
incredible experiences, challenges, and growth. But as fulfilling as my work at
Apple was, it came with certain limitations‚Äîmost notably, the company‚Äôs strict
policies regarding personal expression online. Blogging, a platform I once
freely embraced to share thoughts, ideas, and experiences, had to take a
backseat due to these draconian rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple‚Äôs approach to employee communication is well-known for its rigor. The
company prioritizes confidentiality and control over its narrative, which means
that employees are often restricted from sharing their work or opinions
publicly. For someone who thrives on writing and sharing insights, this was a
tough adjustment. The rules are there for good reasons, protecting innovation
and maintaining a unified message, but they also stifle personal expression,
making it nearly impossible to keep up a blog without crossing lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I step away from that chapter, I find myself eager to reconnect with the
blogging community. The hiatus has given me new perspectives and a deeper
understanding of technology, innovation, and the complexities of working within
such a tightly controlled environment. I‚Äôm excited to bring these insights into
my writing, blending my experiences at Apple with a renewed commitment to open
and honest dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging again feels like a breath of fresh air‚Äîa chance to engage with ideas
and conversations that were put on hold. I look forward to sharing more in the
coming weeks and months, exploring new topics, and reconnecting with readers
who, like me, value the freedom to express themselves openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, more posts coming in the next few weeks talking about what I‚Äôm doing
next and where that‚Äôs happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
