        <title>I&apos;m back</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Returning to the world of blogging after nearly four years at Apple feels like
rediscovering an old friend. The time away has been transformative, filled with
incredible experiences, challenges, and growth. But as fulfilling as my work at
Apple was, it came with certain limitations—most notably, the company’s strict
policies regarding personal expression online. Blogging, a platform I once
freely embraced to share thoughts, ideas, and experiences, had to take a
backseat due to these draconian rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s approach to employee communication is well-known for its rigor. The
company prioritizes confidentiality and control over its narrative, which means
that employees are often restricted from sharing their work or opinions
publicly. For someone who thrives on writing and sharing insights, this was a
tough adjustment. The rules are there for good reasons, protecting innovation
and maintaining a unified message, but they also stifle personal expression,
making it nearly impossible to keep up a blog without crossing lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I step away from that chapter, I find myself eager to reconnect with the
blogging community. The hiatus has given me new perspectives and a deeper
understanding of technology, innovation, and the complexities of working within
such a tightly controlled environment. I’m excited to bring these insights into
my writing, blending my experiences at Apple with a renewed commitment to open
and honest dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging again feels like a breath of fresh air—a chance to engage with ideas
and conversations that were put on hold. I look forward to sharing more in the
coming weeks and months, exploring new topics, and reconnecting with readers
who, like me, value the freedom to express themselves openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, more posts coming in the next few weeks talking about what I’m doing
next and where that’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Return to 3d Printing</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about picking up some new 3d printers for awhile now as my
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fusion94.org/2015/09/10/flashforge-creator-pro/&quot;&gt;FlashForge Creator
Pros&lt;/a&gt; are starting to
show their age and one just doesn’t print at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting new printers (other than having a up-to-date platform) serves a few
purposes for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, Patrick is getting to the age (10) where he’s spending a lot of time on
his smartphone and in games. I hope to use 3d Printing to teach him new skills,
empower his creativity, make family memories, and teach him a world of science
and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did a little bit of research and decided to go with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-s1-pro-fdm-3d-printer&quot;&gt;Creality Ender 3 S1
Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-creality&quot;&gt;Enter Creality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s been a great printer with regards to ease of unboxing/installation
as well as the overall quality of the prints w/o any tuning whatsoever. It was
truly the easiest printer I’ve ever assembled. IIRC it was literally 11 bolts.
Dead Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;some-of-the-key-features-are&quot;&gt;Some of the key features are:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print size: 220 x 220 x 270 mm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to 300°C high-temp printing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full-metal dual-gear direct extruder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CR-touch automatic leveling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4.3″ display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to assemble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to setup and tuning? Straight out of the box it’s an amazing
printer. Here are a couple of shots of it as well as some of the initial prints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/3d-printing/creality-ender-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/3d-printing/ce3-print-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/3d-printing/ce3-print-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/3d-printing/ce3-print-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Gallery / Creality&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, after doing some additional research I ended up reading a ton
of reviews and watching many, many YouTube videos about the Bambu X1-Carbon. Due
to some of these reviews I bit the bullet and pulled the trigger on one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-bambu&quot;&gt;Enter Bambu&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased a &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon-combo&quot;&gt;Bambu X1-Carbon
Combo&lt;/a&gt; on 7/17/2023 and it
arrived via UPS on 7/20/2023. It sat in it’s box for a few days until I could
find time for the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The printer is shipped in a pretty large cardboard box, with foam protection on
the sides. The printer is packed well so I didn’t expect any kind of damage
during shipping. It can be easily taken out from the package by simply pulling
from the sides of the plastic bag (But do take care here as plastic bags have a
tendency to rip and tear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the printer comes pre-assembled (mostly); before you can start printing
you will need to remove a few screws that hold some parts in place during
shipping. If you purchased the AMS unit you will also need to remove it from the
printer’s enclosure via a few additional screws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also need to attach the touchscreen to the printer via a supplied
ribbon cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the assembly process took longer than the Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro but
will still under an hour and signficantly easier that other printers that I’ve
owned in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;some-of-the-key-features-and-improvements&quot;&gt;Some of the Key features and improvements:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large 256mm x 256mm x 256mm Build Volume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compatible Printing Materials Up to 300°C&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-In Camera Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compatible with Abrasive Filaments (NylonX, NylonG, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capable of Multi-Color and Multi-Material 3D Printing
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Up to 16 colors printing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High quality printing with 7 μm Lidar Resolution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High speed CoreXY with 20000 mm/s² Acceleration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dual Auto Bed Leveling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI inspected first layer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spaghetti failure detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some feedback and a few thoughts after owning the Bambu for a few
months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;1-its-very-fast&quot;&gt;1) It’s very fast.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very very fast. I did a large sample print as a reference
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall/files#preview:file-QLLx0&quot;&gt;wall-honeycomb-part.stl&lt;/a&gt;
and the Bambu was approximately 240.63% faster than the Creality Ender 3 S1
Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Printer&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Total Time&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Time in Minutes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bambu&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1h 36m&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Creality&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5h 27m&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;327&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;2-its-slow&quot;&gt;2) It’s slow.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this I mean it’s not slow at printing it’s slow at getting ready to print. On
average about 7.3% of the total print time is in setup or prep. i.e. homing the
bed and leveling, checking resonance, calibrating input shaping and pressure
advance for extrusion. This also doesn’t account for bed and nozzle heating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;3-extruderhot-end-swap&quot;&gt;3) Extruder/Hot End swap&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the hotend/extruder on the Creality is as simple as grabbing a wrench,
untightening the exiting nozzle and tightening the new nozzle. As Bambu uses a
completely integrated hotend/extruder it’s slightly more complicated. Here’s how
that works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;removal&quot;&gt;Removal&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the Temperature/Axis settings and make sure your hotend temperature is
at 30c or below, then turn the power OFF&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the magnetic cover and move it aside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gently remove the bigger 2-pin plug of the ceramic heater, the 4-pin plug of
the cooling fan and the very small 2-pin plug of the thermistor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the H2 Allen key to unscrew the 2 screws that are near the top of the
nozzles’ heatsink&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carefully and gently move the wires out of the plastic wire clip and remove
the complete hotend assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Position the complete hotend assembly so that the 2 screw holes will be
behind the bracket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gently push the 2 screws in and then tighten them equally (but careful not to
overtighten)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug in the bigger 2-pin ceramic heater plug, the 4-pin cooling fan plug, and
the very small 2-pin thermistor plug&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Route all the loose cables through the plastic wire clip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the magnetic cover… and you are done!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, slightly more complicated but not completely horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;4-build-plates&quot;&gt;4) Build Plates&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default the Bambu X1-C comes with both the Bambu Cool Plate and a Bambu
Engineering Plate which is going to require the use of a glue stick or painter’s
tape to ensure great adhesion. The Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro by default came with
a spring steel textured PEI plate which is far superior. If you chose to pick up
a Bambu X1-C then you should (at the time of purchase) add on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-textured-pei-plate&quot;&gt;Bambu Textured
PEI Plate&lt;/a&gt; as
well. Trust me it’s worth the $37.99 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;5-filaments&quot;&gt;5) Filaments&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bambu X1-C comes with some starter filament. One of the things I love about
the AMS unit is the ability to read and register filament via RFID.
Unfortunately this is only available through the use of Bambu Filaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially the price of Bambu filaments versus say Polymaker there appears to be
a $3 to $4 difference per kg. While this might be a problem for some I’ve not
found it to be a showstopper due to the aforementioned RFID tagging for
filament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other things to note is that once you have a few empty spools or order the
empty spools from Bambu for the most part you should be ordered filament via the
refill option which brings the prices inline with Polymaker. The process of
refilling a spool takes 3-4 minutes and requires no tools or winders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filament orders can only happen through the Bambu Store, there is no Amazon
option (booooooo) and shipping options (via FedEx) can take up to 10 days so
plan accordingly. I think my second filament order was in the neighborhood of
30kgs and somewhere around $750 USD but I didn’t have to order filament for a
few more months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked my original Bambu X1-C so much that I ending up purchasing a second unit
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I earnestly believe that the Bambu X1-C printer delivers commercial quality at a
consumer price point and it’s well worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo gallery of some of the prints from the Bambu X1-C:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can certainly state the experience now days is significantly better than when
I put my first 3D Printer together, a Prusa Mendel that is show below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/3d-printing/prusa-mendel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prusa Mendel&quot; title=&quot;Prusa Mendel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference that mendel was put together in 2011 and the printable parts were
printed using a Makerbot Cupcake CNC from 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for some gratuitous photos of that Cupcake CNC&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dual Universe Release</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dual Universe is a first person based space simulation sandbox massively
multiplayer online role play game (MMORPG) video game in development by the
Paris-based game development studio, Novaquark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last few years I’ve sunk an enormous amount of time playing
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dualuniverse.game/&quot;&gt;Dual Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Which for the most part I’ve
thoroughly enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It basically combined elements of games I’ve played for years now,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eveonline.com/&quot;&gt;Eve Online&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2003) and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nomanssky.com/&quot;&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2016). It also
incorporates bits and pieces from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minecraft.net/&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through my email I was able to locate this one from August, 28th, 2019 or
3 years ago to the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello Novean,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You recently signed up to create a Dual Universe account. To validate your
email, please click on the link below to finalize setting up your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent years invested in DU and have reported bugs and exploits over that
time. I’ve spent day’s on end in mining for resources (prior to automatic mining
units) just so that I could build Space Station’s and other bases on multiple
planets. I currently have 4 characters/accounts in-game and between the 4
characters I have accumulated somewhere close to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;171m Talent Points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.27b Quanta (in-game currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game launched in May 2016 in its &lt;strong&gt;pre-alpha&lt;/strong&gt; state and entered &lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt; in
August of 2020. The &lt;strong&gt;live release&lt;/strong&gt; date for Dual Universe is 27 September 2022. The question of whether Dual Universe will wipe its servers at launch is
one that has been hanging over players’ heads as far back as June when the devs
at Novaquark openly ruminated about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 9th, Novaquark &lt;a href=&quot;https://board.dualthegame.com/index.php?/topic/25065-dual-universe-reset-news-announcement/&quot;&gt;announced that yes&lt;/a&gt;, there will be a full server reset
at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing players will still retain their blueprints, friend lists, and guild
details, while everything from planets to territories to constructs will be
reset. This is being done for several reasons, including to give everyone even
footing, better balance the economy, improve performance, and add new planets as
well as adjust existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;thank-you&lt;/strong&gt; to beta testers, DU will be handing out Pioneer Packs full of
talent points, currency, and other materials in order to give players back some
of their progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIONEER PACK - EXOTIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This package is available to players who have purchased at least thirteen months
of subscription for the Dual Universe beta. Please note that it’s not necessary
to have used the game time by this date to qualify for this bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This package is also available to our Gold backers and above from our
crowdfunding campaigns, as well as Sponsors and Patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to 52,992,000 extra talent points, including the server-wide accelerator event and the beta talent point awards, by the end of the 6-month launch event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 monthly payments of 400,000 quanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 Schematic copies of Dynamic Core Unit S&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 Schematic copies of Dynamic Core Unit M&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 Schematic copies of Dynamic Core Unit L&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tier 3 Rare Item - 1 Circinus collectible statue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 exclusive decorative items: Deco potted plant white, Deco carpet, Deco potted plant black&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://board.dualthegame.com/index.php?/topic/25064-reset-news-announcement-discussion-thread/&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;
to the server reset by the players has been mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I’m not sure how I feel about the idea of the reset. From a game
balancing standpoint I totally understand it. They want to ensure that the new
players that will be joining for the first time on launch will not feel
disadvantaged. On the other hand, DU has been in beta for 2 years now and anyone
could have put down a credit card and started playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the tiered-pioneer pack is setup, my 3 years of work during the beta
means just as much as anyone that signs up today (for at least a 13 month
subscription) will get the same pioneer pack as me and yet I’ve invested
countless more hours and money into DU. That’s some &lt;strong&gt;thank-you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me this seems like a quick cash grab from Novaquark especially considering
the game has been in development for 8 years (bleeding money) and also that at
launch, the version launching is in many ways inferior to the version that’s
currently running as beta. Not all the planets that are currently in beta will
be launching. Some will be delayed for awhile. This will lead to some early
initial planets suffering from overcrowding and can potentially lead to whole
planets becoming like Market 6 on Alioth back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what’s most likely to happen is that I will continue to invest a little
bit of time into Dual Universe after launch but uncertain as to whether or not I
will renew my subscriptions on expiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a real shame as DU had so much potential but for whatever reason never
quite reached it. I would respect NQ a hell of a lot more if they’d just come
out and state &lt;strong&gt;“hey we’re running out of cash and need to launch with a new
influx of cash and new players to ensure we can continue to develop DU”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead we get typical NQ marketing bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Droning in Texas</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Federal law requires all recreational flyers to pass an aeronautical knowledge
and safety test. The FAA developed The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)
to meet this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working at a friends working ranch just outside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrville,_Texas&quot;&gt;Kerrville
Texas&lt;/a&gt; since February under what
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; calls a Temporary Remote Working Arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I reached out to my buddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDJTTSDMIOMVrxNfssXcMrQ&quot;&gt;Michael
Rollins&lt;/a&gt; with regards
to drones as the ranch owner wanted to purchase one to perform random tasks on
the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Michael way back in 2004-2005 or so playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldofwarcraft.com/&quot;&gt;World of
Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years we’ve become pretty good
friends and one of his many hobbies has been flying and building drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Michael’s recommendation a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dji.com/phantom-4-pro-v2?site=brandsite&amp;amp;from=eol_phantom-4-pro&quot;&gt;DJI Phanton
4&lt;/a&gt;
was purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-tasks&quot;&gt;Drone Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the tasks that can be performed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;surveying pastures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;surveying fences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wildlife surveys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;roof inspections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pasture surveying, aerial technology lets ranchers easily map plant height,
plant health, monitor weather damage as well as irrigation across their
properties, so that they can take immediate action when issues arise. This will
generally require additional 3rd party sensors and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fencing is an area of ranching that frequently requires a lot of attention and
upkeep. Previous to drone technology, workers would survey the perimeter of the
ranch to ensure the fence was still intact. A broken fence causes issues like
allowing animals to escape, providing easy access inside to hunters, or mixing
livestock with neighbors. By using software features like Live Map, ranchers can
pinpoint the affected areas before physically arriving with their tools. Not
only does this cut down on time, but it’s also a more reliable method than
out-of-date or cloudy satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing a drone for wildlife surveys is more accurate and consistent compared
to alternatives like manned aviation or physically walking the property. One can
fly lower than manned aviation to get higher quality images and be more
transparent than a team physically walking around the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-training-and-use&quot;&gt;Drone Training and Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a recreational drone pilot you need to understand some basic rules and get
certified by taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/&quot;&gt;The Recreational UAS
Safety Test
(TRUST)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUST stands for The Recreational UAS Safety Test. It provides education and
testing for recreational drone flyers on important safety and regulatory
information. If you fly your drone recreationally under the Exception for
Recreational Flyers, you must pass the test before you fly. Federal law requires
all recreational flyers to pass an aeronautical knowledge and safety test. The
FAA developed The Recreational UAS Safety Test to meet this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUST is free, can be taken online through a variety of FAA-approved test
administrators, and typically takes 30 minutes or less to complete. After you
pass the test, you will receive a completion certificate. &lt;strong&gt;Be sure to keep this
certificate with you when you fly your drone, either in paper or electronic
format.&lt;/strong&gt; Test administrators will not keep a record of your completion
certificate, therefore if you lose your certificate, you need re-take the TRUST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below organizations have all been approved by the FAA to administer the
TRUST as of April 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;basic-rules&quot;&gt;Basic Rules&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you must fly your drone within visual line of sight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stay below 400ft altitude&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stay at least 5 miles away from an airport that might have a Part 107 requirement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flight operations during daylight hours only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few additional rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All drones must be registered, except those that weigh 0.55 pounds or less
(less than 250 grams) and are flown exclusively under the Exception for
Recreational Flyers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drones registered under part 107 may be flown for recreational purposes as
well as under part 107.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drones registered under the Exception for Recreational Flyers cannot be flown
for Part 107 operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the DJI Phantom 4 weighs 1380 grams I needed to register the drone with
the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-to-register&quot;&gt;How to Register&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;information-needed-to-register&quot;&gt;Information Needed to Register&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical address and mailing address (if different from physical address)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phone number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make and model of your drone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specific Remote ID serial number provided by the manufacturer (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Credit or debit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;registration-fees&quot;&gt;Registration Fees&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 107 registration costs $5 per drone and is valid for three (3) years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Exception for Recreational Flyers registration costs $5 and is valid for
three (3) years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once registered, drone registration cannot be transferred between types (part
107 or the Exception for Recreational Flyers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;registration-requirements&quot;&gt;Registration Requirements&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;13 years of age or older (if the owner is less than 13 years of age, a person
13 years of age or older must register the drone)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For foreign operators, FAA will consider the certificate issued to be a
recognition of ownership rather than a certificate of U.S. aircraft
registration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;after-you-register&quot;&gt;After you Register&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you register your drone, you will receive an FAA registration certificate.
&lt;strong&gt;You must have your registration certificate (either a paper copy or digital
copy) in your possession when you fly. If another individual operates your
drone, they must have your drone registration certificate (either a paper or
digital copy) in their possession.&lt;/strong&gt; Federal law requires drone operators who
are required to register, to show their certificate of registration to any
Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer if asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to register a drone that requires registration may result in regulatory
and criminal penalties. The FAA may assess civil penalties up to $27,500.
Criminal penalties include fines of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to
three (3) years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAA requires that you mark all drones with your registration number before
you fly them. Here is how to label your drone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be maintained in a condition that is legible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be affixed to the small unmanned aircraft by any means necessary to
ensure that it will remain affixed for the duration of each operation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be legibly displayed on an external surface of the small unmanned
aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion the steps you need to take to safely operate your drone and remain
within legal compliance isn’t all that hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;random-photos&quot;&gt;Random Photos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few shots that I was able to get on my first few flights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Living in Mountain Lion Country</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem for bike riders, joggers and hikers in the wilderness is that the
mountain lion has its own habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Pat McDonnell&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this security camera footage was captured earlier this week approximately a
1/2 mile from my house. As such I thought it was time to write a post in regards
to Mountain Lions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;/assets/videos/mountain-lion.mp4&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;california-mountain-lions&quot;&gt;California Mountain Lions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of California is mountain lion habitat. Mountain lions generally
exist wherever deer are found. They are solitary and elusive, and their nature
is to avoid humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain lions primarily eat deer, but, if allowed, they will prey on vulnerable
pets and livestock. In extremely rare cases, even people have fallen prey to
mountain lions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain lions that threaten people are immediately killed. Those that prey on
pets or livestock can be killed by a property owner after the required permit is
secured. Moving problem mountain lions is not an option. It causes deadly
territorial conflicts with other mountain lions already there. Or the relocated
mountain lion returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;living-in-mountain-lion-country&quot;&gt;Living in Mountain Lion Country&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acknowledge that you live in mountain lion country and make a commitment to
educate yourself. Talk to your neighbors and work together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never feed deer or other wildlife; it is illegal to feed deer and other big
game in California and it will attract mountain lions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deer-proof your landscaping by avoiding plants that deer like to eat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trim brush to reduce hiding places for mountain lions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t leave small children or pets outside unattended.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install motion-sensitive lighting around the house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide sturdy, covered shelters for sheep, goats, and other vulnerable
animals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t allow pets outside when mountain lions are most active—dawn, dusk, and
at night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring pet food inside to avoid attracting raccoons, opossums and other
potential mountain lion prey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-to-do-if-you-encounter-a-mountain-lion&quot;&gt;What to do if you Encounter a Mountain Lion&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain lions are quiet, solitary and elusive, and typically avoid people by
nature. However, as human population expands into mountain lion habitat, more
frequent sightings may occur and human/mountain lion encounters may increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare. However, attacks have
occurred in California. Understanding mountain lion behavior and how to act
responsibly in mountain lion country may greatly reduce potential conflict with
these majestic animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following safety information is a compilation taken from wildlife managers,
wildlife officers and scientists that study mountain lion behavior. Although no
strategy in the event of an encounter is guaranteed to be successful in every
situation, these tips will help keep you safe in lion country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not hike, bike, or jog alone. Stay alert on trails.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid hiking or jogging when mountain lions are most active – dawn, dusk, and
at night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a close watch on small children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Off leash dogs on trails are at increased risk of becoming prey for a
mountain lion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never approach a mountain lion. Give them an escape route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DO NOT RUN. Stay calm. Running may trigger chase, catch and kill response. Do
not turn your back. Face the animal, make noise and try to look bigger by
waving your arms, or opening your jacket if wearing one; throw rocks or other
objects. Pick up small children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not crouch down or bend over. Squatting puts you in a vulnerable position
of appearing much like a 4-legged prey animal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be vocal; however, speak calmly and do not use high pitched tones or high
pitch screams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teach others how to behave during an encounter. Anyone who runs may initiate
an attack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carry and know how to use bear spray to deter a mountain lion. Bear spray has
been shown to be successful in emergency situations with mountain lions. Have
the spray readily accessible. Carry in a holster belt or attach to a mountain
bike. Talk to the folks at your local outdoor store. Make sure you know how to
properly use bear spray. People have been known to spray their own faces when
attempting to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a lion attacks, fight back. Research on mountain lion attacks suggests that
many potential victims have fought back successfully with rocks, sticks,
garden tools, even an ink pen or bare hands. Try to stay on your feet. If
knocked down, try to protect head and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a mountain lion attacks a person, immediately call 911.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Report unusual mountain lion behavior to your local CDFW regional office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a civilized and cultivated country wild animals only continue to exist at
all when preserved by sportsmen. the excellent people who protest against all
hunting, and consider sportsmen as enemies of wild life, are ignorant of the
fact that in reality the genuine sportsman is by all odds the most important
factor in keeping the larger and more valuable wild creatures from total
extermination.&lt;/p&gt;

it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation is to ensure the future of elk
other wildlife, their habitat and our hunting heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of their mission, the RMEF is committed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conserving, restoring and enhancing natural habitats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting the sound management of wild elk, which may be hunted or otherwise
enjoyed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;restoring elk to their native ranges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;educating members and the public about habitat conservation and our hunting
heritage.&lt;/li&gt;

They also recognized there was no group dedicated to North America’s grandest
big game animal, elk. In May of that year, they pooled their time, talent and
resources and created the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, an organization
dedicated to elk, elk hunting and the habitat they need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;hard-work-pays-off&quot;&gt;Hard Work Pays Off&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They set up shop in the back room of a trailer house in Troy, the four; a
pastor,a realtor, a logger and a drive-in owner, created an organization that
would directly benefit elk and other wildlife by putting money to work on the
ground. The team drained their bank accounts and borrowed funds to mail out
43,000 brochures soliciting members, promising a subscription to a magazine
about elk and elk hunting, as well as an annual international convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They received a dismal 233 responses. But they believed they’d made a commitment
to these people. So they borrowed additional funds and printed 32,000 copies of
the premier issue of Bugle magazine, which they mailed out and time, hard work
and patience, but by the end of 1984, membership had grown to almost 2,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-first-of-many-successes-to-come&quot;&gt;The First of Many Successes to Come&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 1985, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation held their first convention in
Spokane, Washington. They also funded their first habitat project that year, a
grant to help fund a prescribed burn in a place fittingly named Elk Creek on the
Kootenai National Forest near Libby, Montana. In 1988, they facilitated their
first land acquisition, the 16,440-acre Robb Creek property in Montana, and
received their first ringing endorsement from the corporate community. At their
annual convention that year, Ray Goff, former RMEF board member and Vice
President of Anheuser-Busch, announced a $500,000 gift from the company. That
gift helped kick off their incredible growth and conservation achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;bursting-at-the-seams&quot;&gt;Bursting at the Seams&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1988, the RMEF staff had grown to 12, and their offices were spread across a
vacant dentist’s office, a mini mall and an abandoned grocery store. They now
had 32,000 members, 2,000 passionate volunteers and 70 chapters, and they had
protected and enhanced more than 110,000 acres of elk country. Bursting at the
seams, it was time to say goodbye to the RMEF’s birthplace and move to Missoula,
Montana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;a-shining-star&quot;&gt;A Shining Star&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, they’ve grown to more than 227,000 members whose support has
protected and enhanced more than 7.3 million acres of North American wildlife
habitat. Hundreds of thousands of these acres were completely off-limits to the
public. They are now open for all to hunt, fish and otherwise enjoy. They employ
more than 120 people and boast more than 11,000 volunteers working through more
than 500 chapters across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the most humble beginnings in 1984, the RMEF has risen to become one of the
most effective and efficient conservation organizations in the United States.
Today, working together with members, volunteers, and partners as Team Elk, the
RMEF is striving to conserve the next million acres of elk country, and to be a
strong voice for hunters, access, and wildlife management and conservation
issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-they-conserve&quot;&gt;How They Conserve&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;land-protection&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#land-protection-programs&quot;&gt;Land Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF permanently protects crucial elk winter and summer ranges, migration
corridors, calving grounds and other vital areas, while focusing on securing and
improving hunter access throughout elk country. Their land conservation tools
include: acquisitions, access agreements and easements, conservation easements,
land and real estate donations, land exchanges and associated acres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;habitat-stewardship&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#habitat-stewardship-programs&quot;&gt;Habitat Stewardship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy habitat is essential for healthy elk and other wildlife. The RMEF helps
fund and conduct a variety of projects to improve essential forage, water, cover
and space components of wildlife habitat, and supports research and management
efforts to help maintain productive elk herds and habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;elk-restoration&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#elk-restoration-programs&quot;&gt;Elk Restoration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF works to reestablish elk herds in historic ranges where the habitat and
human cultural tolerance create a high potential for self-sustaining herds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;land-protection-programs&quot;&gt;Land Protection Programs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1984, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has permanently protected more
than 1,700 square miles of prime habitat for elk and other wildlife across the
country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF uses advanced habitat mapping technology (GIS) to identify and
prioritize the most crucial elk winter and summer ranges, migration corridors
and calving areas. They then work with their partners, including willing
landowners, government agencies, corporations, foundations and other
conservation groups to permanently protect the most critical habitat and target
areas for public access. Their land conservation tools include: &lt;strong&gt;land
acquisitions, conservation easements, access agreements and easements, land and
real estate donations, contributions, land exchanges and associated acres.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their goals are to permanently protect the most critical elk habitat and to
increase public access opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;land-acquisitions&quot;&gt;Land Acquisitions&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF purchases key elk habitat to protect wildlife values. In most cases,
they do not retain ownership. Most often, they convey it to a federal or state
management agency (state wildlife department, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of
Land Management, etc.). The agency then acts as a steward of the land,
protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat, while providing the public increased
recreational opportunities, including hunting and fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;conservation-easements&quot;&gt;Conservation Easements&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conservation easement protects wildlife habitat on private property. It is a
voluntary legal agreement with a landowner to protect their land in perpetuity
from development and other uses that could diminish its wildlife habitat values
but still allows for many traditional uses of the land. The land remains in
private ownership and in many instances the landowner may qualify for tax
benefits. Although it is not required, the RMEF encourages landowners to allow
public access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;land-and-real-estate-donations&quot;&gt;Land and Real Estate Donations&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donating land for conservation purposes is one of the finest legacies a person
can leave to future generations. The RMEF may accept donations of land or real
estate from private individuals or corporations. Depending on the type of real
estate, they may retain ownership, convey the property to a private citizen
(after protecting it with a conservation easement), state, or federal agency,
or, if the property lacks significant habitat values, sell the donated property
and use the proceeds to protect land with important wildlife values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;contributions&quot;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF may provide funding to state or federal agencies or another nonprofit
organization to assist them with their wildlife habitat protection or public
access efforts. Their contributions often generate additional habitat dollars
from matching grant programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;land-exchanges&quot;&gt;Land Exchanges&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF may assist a government agency or a private landowner in exchanging
lands. These exchanges typically take place when an agency has wildlife habitat
lands it wants to acquire. Many exchanges will result in an increase of lands
that are open for the public to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;associated-acres&quot;&gt;Associated Acres&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the RMEF protects land, those benefits often extend to associated, leased
grazing lands connected to the acquisition. This often results in additional
benefits to wildlife through improved grazing systems and livestock
redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;habitat-stewardship-programs&quot;&gt;Habitat Stewardship Programs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing high quality habitat (food, water, cover and space) is key to ensuring
the future of elk and other wildlife. Research and management projects help
manage elk in ways that guarantee productive herds and provide hunter
opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;habitat-stewardship-program-elements&quot;&gt;Habitat Stewardship Program Elements&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF’s Habitat Stewardship Program is comprised of three elements: &lt;strong&gt;habitat
enhancement, wildlife management and research.&lt;/strong&gt; Financial support for the
program comes from RMEF volunteers who raise funds through local chapter events
for project grants. The RMEF then works with biologists and land managers to
fund projects that will provide wildlife the best bang for the buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;ensuring-a-future-for-elk&quot;&gt;Ensuring a Future for Elk&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF helps ensure that North America’s elk will remain abundant and healthy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by working with federal, state, provincial and tribal land managers as well as
private landowners to restore healthy habitat on public and private lands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by supporting management and research efforts by state and provincial
agencies, universities and private organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;habitat-enhancement&quot;&gt;Habitat Enhancement&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire suppression, invasive weeds, conifer encroachment and drought all degrade
elk habitat. Some, like drought, are just nature’s way. Others, like fire
suppression and weeds, are a direct result of human actions. Using tools such as
&lt;strong&gt;prescribed burning, thinning, fertilization, seeding, water developments,
noxious weed treatments and fencing&lt;/strong&gt;, they are reversing the effects of these
impacts on elk country. Many of their projects enhance habitat on public and
private lands where elk already exist; some are designed to encourage elk to
move onto public lands and away from ranchers’ crops and haystacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;wildlife-management&quot;&gt;Wildlife Management&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing grants for studies and tools such as new elk census techniques, and
telemetry studies to determine habitat use and migration routes, are other ways
that the RMEF helps wildlife managers enhance and maintain wild, free-ranging
elk populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMEF understands that the future of our wild elk herds depends on good
science. Funding projects that research critical factors such as nutritional
needs of elk, predation and disease provides biologists with sound, scientific
data for effective wildlife and habitat management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;elk-restoration-programs&quot;&gt;Elk Restoration Programs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps no higher calling for a conservation organization than to
restore extirpated wildlife species back to their historic ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feasibility-studies&quot;&gt;Feasibility Studies&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, in 1990 the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation began funding
feasibility studies to determine if wild, free-ranging elk still had a place in
some of their former eastern habitats. Partnering with state wildlife agencies
and universities, they asked three important questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can the habitat support elk?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will restoring elk affect the local economy and hunting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And finally, will local citizens accept a restored elk herd?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;repopulating-historic-range&quot;&gt;Repopulating Historic Range&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a feasibility study is completed and a restoration project is approved by
the state wildlife agency and affected landowners, the RMEF and its volunteers
help trap and transfer wild elk from a source herd to their ancestral grounds.
All elk trapped are tested for seven diseases, including brucellosis and
bluetongue, before leaving the trap site. Healthy source herds have been used in
Arizona, Kansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and Alberta’s Elk Island
National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;monitoring-ensures-success&quot;&gt;Monitoring Ensures Success&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once elk reach their new destination, it’s up to the participating wildlife
agency to decide whether they are held in acclimation pens for a few months or
released directly into the wild. Regardless, after they hit the ground the elk
are monitored for three to five years to study such things as movement patterns
and calf survival to ensure proper management of the herd and their habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;restoration-efforts-so-far&quot;&gt;Restoration Efforts So Far&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMEF helped launch successful elk restorations in Wisconsin in 1995, Kentucky in
1997, Tennessee in 2000, Ontario in 1998, the Great Smoky Mountains National
Park in 2001, Missouri in 2011, Virginia in 2012 and West Virginia in 2016. In
addition, RMEF has funded completed feasibility studies in Illinois, Maryland,
New York and West Virginia. The state agencies use the study data to determine
whether or not to restore elk to their respective state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;a-benefit-to-people-and-economies&quot;&gt;A Benefit to People and Economies&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, wild, free-ranging elk are making tracks in places where they haven’t for
more than a century. Local economies benefit from visitors who travel from all
over to catch a glimpse of the wily wapiti. In 2001, Kentucky held its first elk
hunt in 150 years, and Pennsylvania its first hunt in more than 70 years. In
2009, Tennessee also held its first elk hunt in 150 years. As Eastern elk herds
continue to prosper, the RMEF, its volunteers and partners will be there to
welcome calves born beneath the hardwoods, and hear bulls’ bugles echoing across
mountains and through hollows.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>S.47 has been Signed</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All ethics so far evolved rest upon a single premise: that the individual is
a member of a community of interdependent parts. The land ethic simply
enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants and
animals, or collectively the land.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Aldo Leopold&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a massive package of public lands
legislation made up of more than 100 individual bills that were introduced by 50
senators and several U.S. House members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those include measures to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with key reforms
to strengthen its state-side program;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase access and opportunities for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor
recreational activities on federal lands;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide for economic development in dozens of communities through land
exchanges and conveyances;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve western water management by increasing local control, promoting
investment, and facilitating the recovery of endangered species; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conserve treasured landscapes in communities, where such designations are
locally supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as the &lt;em&gt;Natural Resources Management Act&lt;/em&gt;, the bipartisan bill,
S. 47, was renamed the &lt;strong&gt;John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management and
Recreation Act&lt;/strong&gt; in honor of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dingell&quot;&gt;Dingell&lt;/a&gt;, a long-serving member of
Congress who died last month at the age of 92.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump knows that federal lands are meant to provide both peace and
prosperity for the American people, and signing this bill allows us to continue
managing public lands in a balanced way,” David Bernhardt, acting Department of
Interior secretary, said in a statement &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “This bill is extremely beneficial
to the American people, and I look forward to working with Congress and local
communities to implement the many local conservation wins within the bill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights of the bill include permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, expanded hunting and fishing opportunities on dozens of
national wildlife refuges and thousands more acres of other public lands, and a
provision allowing archery hunters to carry unarmed bows across National Park
Service land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a news release &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the bill also
“advances important North Dakota priorities.” Among those priorities, the bill
streamlines the process for transferring titles from the Bureau of Reclamation
to local authorities, said Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee. That aligns with legislation Hoeven introduced to transfer
the title for the Oakes Test Area to the Dickey-Sargent Irrigation District in
the southeast part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill also includes legislation Hoeven and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.,
introduced to improve and expand the North Country Scenic Trail, which runs from
New York to North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grassroots group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers called Tuesday’s signing of
the bill a “significant victory for public lands sportsmen and women.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Together, the public lands grassroots nation rose up to ensure the passage of
this historic bill,” Land Tawney, BHA president and CEO, said in a statement
&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “We wrote letters, we made phone calls, we met with our elected officials
and we traveled from across the country to Washington, D.C., and together we
made our voices heard. Today, we can celebrate a victory that has been years in
the making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said the president’s effort to achieve U.S. energy
dominance while working with Congress to create a conservation legacy “exceeds
the accomplishments of his recent predecessors” with the signing of the lands
package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This law will benefit every state and clear the deck of issues that we’ve been
working to resolve for years,” Murkowski said in a statement &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “From
providing access for sportsmen to creating new economic opportunities for local
communities, this is a good, balanced measure. We built it through a team effort
that drew strong support from both parties in both chambers. Today is a triumph
for good process and good policy, and this bill is a win for Alaskans and all
Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conservation - One more Step</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see
land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and
respect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Aldo Leopold&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vote by the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday supported a massive
package of conservation and public access bills that permanently reauthorizes
the Land and Water Conservation Fund and advances other key measures, edging
hunters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts closer to a hard-won and
long-awaited victory. The legislation now heads to the president’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most sweeping conservation leglislation in over a decade, protecting
millions of acres of land and hundreds of miles of wild rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Natural Resources Management Act (S. 47)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; encompasses the consensus
priorities of sportsmen and women as well as a bipartisan cadre of senators who
have worked to ensure the legislation’s survival. Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell’s (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) and Sen. Lisa
Murkowski’s (R-AK) ongoing efforts that began last Congress paid off with
today’s overwhelming 363-62 with 6 non-votes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; vote in support of the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House vote was a resounding affirmation of bipartisan support for the
legislation. The bill includes measures sought by lawmakers from most every
state, including a smattering of pet projects, and might also be an indication
that to reach broad consensus in Washington, D.C., the sausage-making requires a
serving or two of locally sourced pork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House passed the bill, under suspension of its rules, which means it
required a two-thirds vote of approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key features of &lt;strong&gt;S. 47&lt;/strong&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund with 3
percent dedicated to securing hunting and fishing access opportunities on
public lands and waters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Methow Valley permanent mineral withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;California Desert Protection and Recreation Act.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cerro del Yuta and Rio San Antonio wilderness areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reauthorization of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Partners for Fish and
Wildlife program at current funding levels of $51.6 million until FY2022.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reauthorization of Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act at $6.5 million
until FY2022, a $2.6 million increase of funding from currently enacted
levels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authorization for hunters with archery equipment to cross National Park
Service lands by foot or horseback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The masses are awakening, and the public lands revolution is growing,”
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snewsnet.com/tag/backcountry-hunters-anglers&quot;&gt;Backcountry Hunters &amp;amp;
Anglers&lt;/a&gt; President and
CEO Land Tawney said. “Today’s vote by the House of Representatives, coming on
the heels of the Senate’s overwhelming support of S. 47 earlier this month,
proves without a doubt that citizens’ voices do count and our nation’s
congressional leaders can come together to advance meaningful bipartisan
legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fusion94.org/blog/2019-02-14/a-partial-win-for-conservation/&quot;&gt;act’s passage through the
Senate&lt;/a&gt;
and now the House comes at a time when politics are particularly contentious and
split. But because it touches on all 50 states and appeases environmentalists,
anglers, sportsmen, and every other variety of recreationists, the legislation
received support from both sides of the aisle, with little debate on the House
floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;voting-breakdown&quot;&gt;Voting Breakdown&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier the voting was 363-62 with 6 non-votes.

        <title>Elk Bolognese</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bolognese sauce (UK: /ˌbɒləˈneɪz, -ˈnɛz/, US: /ˌboʊlənˈjeɪz/;[1] known in
Italian as ragù alla bolognese, pronounced [raˈɡu alla boloɲˈɲeːze; -eːse],
ragù bolognese, or simply ragù) is a meat-based sauce originating from
Bologna, Italy, hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the season there isn’t much that warms a soul better than a big
plate of pasta topped with a classic, slow-cooked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolognese_sauce&quot; title=&quot;Bolognese Sauce&quot;&gt;Bolognese
Sauce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sauce with rules. It is built on a base of onion, carrot and celery.
Nor does it have lots of herbs in it. The sauce contains dairy products. And
tomato, while present, is not the star of the sauce. The meat is. And to make a
real Bolognese, it must cook a &lt;strong&gt;long, long time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most wild game recipes, I have tweaked the classic just a bit to make it
work with elk. Since elk is leaner than the traditional mixture of ground beef
chuck and ground pork in most Bolognese sauce recipes, I add a bit of fat in the
form of diced bacon (although one could use pancetta). The bacon itself breaks
down during the relatively long cooking time, so you don’t really notice it in
the final dish, but the flavor and texture that the small amount of pork fat
really adds to the dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 pounds ground elk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6-8 slices bacon (diced) (pancetta could also be used here)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 medium onion (finely chopped)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 stalk celery (finely chopped)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large carrot (finely chopped)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 shallot (finely chopped)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 cloves garlic (minced)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons tomato paste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup beef broth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup dry red wine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 can (28 ounce) San Marzano tomatoes (crushed)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1-2 bay leaf&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon dried oregano&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon dried basil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup whole milk or cream (you will need to use double cream to prevent any
separating &lt;em&gt;(48–60% fat content)&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 ½ pounds dry Tagliatelle pasta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano cheese for grating&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;prep-work&quot;&gt;Prep Work&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by either chopping or dicing your basic ingredients. This would include
your bacon, onion, celery, carrot, shallot and garlic. I also portion out my dry
ingredients in small stainless steel portion cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ingredients.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; height=&quot;70%&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;captions&quot;&gt;
Prep Work Done.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;cooking-instructions&quot;&gt;Cooking Instructions&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by adding the olive oil and diced bacon to a heavy pot (an enameled cast
iron pot is perfect) using medium heat. Render the bacon (or pancetta) until
crisp. Next add the diced onion, carrot, celery and shallot and cook for
approximately fifteen minutes, stirring often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the ground elk and cook till it is browned through, this should take about
15 minutes. Add the garlic and raise the heat to medium-high then add the wine
and beef broth. Cook sauce until wine and broth are mostly evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn down the heat to a simmer and add oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and red
pepper flakes. Let this cook for approximately 20 minutes. Now add the crushed
tomatoes and tomato paste and bring heat up until you have a boil. After a few
minutes, reduce the heat to a simmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the sauce simmer (very slowly) partially covered for about 2 to 4 hours (the
longer the better), do stir occasionally to prevent sticking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sauce.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; height=&quot;70%&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;captions&quot;&gt;
Bolognese is done.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5 to 10 minutes before serving, add milk or cream and butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before the sauce is finished, bring one gallon of water to a boil, add two
tablespoons of salt and the pasta. Cook for eight to 10 minutes or until the
pasta is al dente. Top with the bolognese sauce and cheese just before serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/final_product.webp&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; height=&quot;70%&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;captions&quot;&gt;
The Final Product.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
