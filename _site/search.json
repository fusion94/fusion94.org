      "content"  : "Bambu Lab’s Automatic Material System and the Importance of Humidity ControlThe Bambu Lab Automatic Material System (AMS) revolutionizes 3D printing bystreamlining filament management for multi-material and multi-color projects.Designed to work seamlessly with Bambu Lab’s advanced 3D printers, the AMSautomates filament swapping and ensures precise material handling, eliminatingmanual intervention during complex prints. With its smart storage andcompatibility with various filament types, it enhances productivity and reducesthe risk of errors, making it an essential tool for professionals and hobbyistsalike.A feature of the AMS is its focus on humidity control, a critical factor inmaintaining filament quality. It does this by utilizing an air-tight seal andwith the help of dessicant material, it absorbs moisture to keep the moistureaway from filament.A Humidity Sensor also detects the humidity inside the AMS and providesinformation to the user when the humidity is higher or the dessicant may need tobe replaced.Why Minimize Humidity?Humidity can wreak havoc on filament properties. When filaments absorb moisture,several issues can arise during printing. Moisture-laden filaments can lead topoor adhesion between layers, causing warping or misshaping of the final print.Additionally, when moisture in the filament is heated during the printingprocess, it turns into steam, creating tiny bubbles or voids in the extrudedmaterial, which severely affects the strength and aesthetics of the print.The Science Behind Humidity ImpactAt a microscopic level, moisture impacts the filament’s viscosity during themelting process. This alteration can lead to inconsistent extrusion rates, whichare critical for precision in 3D printing. Filaments like PLA, PETG, and especiallyhygroscopic materials like Nylon or TPU can absorb moisture from the air,leading to compromised prints, such as stringing, bubbling, or weak layeradhesion.ImprovementsAlthough the AMS system performs well in maintaining a consistent and steadyhumidity level, there is still room for improvement to optimize its performance.While it effectively handles standard conditions, certain scenarios orenvironmental factors may expose limitations in its ability to maintain idealhumidity levels.One of the most significant issues I’ve noticed is that the desiccant used (andsold by Bambu) isn’t rechargeable. To be frank, it’s not particularly effectiveeither. Each AMS unit relies on two desiccant packs, which, in my experience,only last about a month—even in a relatively dry environment. And did I mentionthey’re not rechargeable? This is because the desiccant is made from calciumchloride (CaCl2), which inherently lacks the ability to beregenerated for repeated use.  Calcium chloride is an inorganic compound – a salt with the chemical formulaCaCl2. It is white flakes or pellets at room temperature, and is highlysoluble in water.Enter AMS DryPodsdesigned by mcmaven. With over 28kdownloads it’s one of the best solutions out there.What are DryPods you might be asking? DryPods are compact desiccant packsdesigned to absorb moisture and reduce humidity in enclosed spaces. DryPodstypically contain a hygroscopic material, such as silica gel or calciumchloride, which attracts and traps moisture from the air. Depending on theirdesign, some DryPods are reusable and can be recharged by heating to expelabsorbed moisture, while others are single-use and need replacement afterbecoming saturated.These DryPods are 3d printable and contain printable desiccant trays as well asdesiccant containers that slide inbetween the first stage feeder motors. Thecontainers come in several variations to include Wide DryPod options that canhold hygrometers.  For Bambu or compatible Round Hygrometer with vertical or 30 degree tabs,with a hole all the way through it, which should generate more accuratemeasurements. A 42mm diameter x 14mm deep body and a 46mm diameter bezel issupported. (Default on Plate 1.)  For Bambu or compatible Round Hygrometer with a shallow hole for thehygrometer, which allows the DryPod hold more desiccant, but may be lessaccurate in measuring the overall humidity level of the AMS. A 42mm diameter x14mm deep body and a 46mm diameter bezel is supported. (Floating).  For the Bambu Rectangular Hygrometer.  A 45x26x15mm body and a 48x29mm bezelis supported. (Floating).  For the Xiaomi Bluetooth Thermometer Hygrometer. A 43x43x12.5 mm body issupported.(Floating).The integration of a hygrometer in the AMS DryPods setup allows for real-timemonitoring of the humidity levels. This precision ensures that the environmentwithin the DryPod remains at an ideal humidity level, often recommended to bebelow 15% for most materials.There are also smaller containers (narrower) that can be slotted on the outsideof the feeder motors.With fresh desiccant, the humidity dropped to 10% (Level 1) within a few hoursand remained as low as 20% (Level 2) even after six months.Stefan from CNC Kitchen has created an excellent and detailed video exploringthe different types of desiccants, their pros and cons, and various methods fordrying them. While he focuses heavily on filament bags, the drying techniques heexplains are equally applicable to loose desiccant. It’s an insightful resourcefor anyone looking to optimize moisture control.ConclusionThe integration of systems like the Bambu Lab AMS with advanced humiditycontrols such as DryPods using rechargeable desiccant highlights the growingsophistication of 3D printing technology. By tackling the critical issue ofhumidity’s impact on filaments, Bambu Lab is setting a new standard forreliability and efficiency in 3D printing. These innovations empower bothenthusiasts and professionals to achieve higher-quality results with greaterconsistency. As the industry continues to evolve, systems like these are likelyto become essential tools in the world of additive manufacturing.Stuff I use  Hygrometer  Dry &amp; Dry Silica Beads",

In 2024, I set a modest goal for myself toread 16 books. Reading has always been a way for me to unwind and learn, butlast year, it became more than just a hobby—it became a journey of discovery andachievement. To my own surprise, I didn’t just meet my goal; I soared past it,finishing 23 books and covering a whopping 8,037 pages!This experience was illuminating in several ways. Not only did it reaffirm mylove for reading, but it also pushed me to explore genres and authors I mightnot have considered before. The books ranged from technical tomes that enhancedmy professional skills to imaginative works of fiction that transported me todifferent worlds. Each page turned added a new layer to my understanding andappreciation of the written word, making the year both enriching andintellectually satisfying.Inspired by last year’s success, I’ve decided to ambitiously set my 2025 readinggoal at 30 books. This new target is not just about quantity, but also aboutcontinuing to diversify the types of books I engage with. I plan to delve deeperinto non-fiction, exploring topics in history and science, while still enjoyingthe fictional realms of fantasy and mystery that I love so much.Reaching this goal will undoubtedly require discipline and dedication,especially with a busy schedule. However, the joy and knowledge gained from eachbook make every minute spent reading worthwhile. I’m excited about thechallenges and discoveries that lie ahead in my 2025 reading adventure.For those looking to embark on their own reading journey, or anyone seeking tosurpass their previous achievements, let’s remind ourselves that goals are notjust endpoints but stepping stones to greater achievements.

It involves imagininga desired outcome, even if it’s unrealistic or unlikely, because it aligns withpersonal desires or fantasies. This type of thinking can lead people to makedecisions based on what they want to happen rather than what is actuallyprobable or reasonable.For example, someone might hope for a promotion at work despite a lack ofqualifications, just because they want it to happen. Or someone might ignoresigns of an unhealthy relationship, believing it will improve on its own becausethey deeply wish it will.

      "content"  : "Image Credits: karnoff / ShutterstockI’ve been gaming for what seems like forever and to be honest, compared to mostof you I have been. This is a brief history of my love affair with gaming.The Early DaysIn 1977, Atari released the Atari VCS (later known as the Atari 2600).When it was released, the Atari VCS was only designed to play 10 simplechallenge games. However, the console included an external ROM slot where gamecartridges could be plugged in; the potential was quickly discovered byprogrammers around the world, who created games far outperforming the console’soriginal designed.The original list of games:  Air-Sea Battle  Basic Math  Blackjack  Combat  Indy 500  Star Ship  Street Racer  Surround  Video Olympics  PongThe integration of the microprocessor also led to the release of Space Invadersfor the Atari VCS in 1980, signifying a new era of gaming.Atari 2600I got an Atari 2600 sometime right around christmas of 1980 and grew to love thelike Asteroids, Pitfall, Frogger, Pong, Space Invaders and of course Adventure.PC Gaming - The StartIn 1980 I was in sixth grade and attending Lakewood Elementary School in EulessTexas. I got accepted into their “Talented and Gifted Program” and startedtaking programming classes on the TRS 80 using Level III BASIC (Beginners’All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) developed by Microsoft. All ourdevelopment at that time was done using audio cassette drives.Because I had been playing quite a bit of Adventure and the fact that the TRS 80had at best rudimentary graphics I started learning how to program “Adventure”style games on those TRS 80’s.That really was my first adventure into both programming and PC Gaming.PC Gaming - The Next PhaseI continued to play around with programming computers all through High Schooland then ended up in the Military for a few years. While in the military Icontinued to play games mostly on a Commodore 64 System although I also playedaround on the IBM XT (8088 based), the IBM Personal Computer/AT (80286 based)and the XT 286 (also 80286 based).When I left Active Duty Military in 1991 I ended up purchasing a Intel 386 basedsystem which was a 32-bit microprocessor first introduced in 1985 but not reallyaffordable until a few years afterwards.It was at this time that he first real commercial games became available via BBSand were considered shareware. The majority of these games came from iD Softwareand included the following titles:  Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons (released on December 14, 1990)  Wolfenstein 3D (released on May 5, 1992)  Doom (released on December 10, 1993)In 1993/1994 I got my first Intel 486 based system and moved to Silicon Valleyto begin working professionally as a Software Engineer and continued to playvideo games.PC Gaming - MMO PhaseI continued to play most of these games when I first moved to California and in1997 I found Massively Multiplayer Online Games.What exactly is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game?  A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG or more commonly MMO) is an onlinevideo game with a large numbers of players, often hundreds or thousands, onthe same server. MMOs usually feature a huge, persistent open world, althoughthere are games that differ.The list of MMO’s that I started playing in order are:  Ultima Online (released on September 24, 1997)  Everquest (released on March 16, 1999)  Asheron’s Call (released on November 2, 1999)  Anarchy Online (released on June 27, 2001)  Asheron’s Call 2 (released on November 22, 2002)  Eve Online (released on May 6, 2003)  World of Worldcraft (released on November 23, 2004)I was working in Silicon Valley for a few years, and at this point, I hadco-founded the Open Source web site SourceForge and then got laidoff from VA Software. At the time I got laid off I received a really goodpackage and was spending a lot of my time mostly playing Asheron’s Call andAnarchy Online.As a matter of fact, I had stayed up all night playing both of those games whenthe first events of September 11th 2001 occurred.A few months after the events of 9/11 I ended up started a game developmentstudio called Damage Studios.Located in San Francisco, California, Damage Studios is developingRekonstruction as a persistent online title where a futuristic Earth must berebuilt following a devastating asteroid collision.To be continuedWell that’s the end of Part -1. I will be continuing the story about DamageStudios and Rekonstruction in a future post (Part 2) and then conclude my gamingjourney.thanks for reading.",

      "content"  : "Exiting AppleWorking at Apple is often seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry—aplace where innovation thrives and the brightest minds collaborate to createworld-changing products. However, beneath the surface of this high-performanceenvironment lies a culture that can be toxic and stifling, marked by intensemicromanagement and an overwhelming pressure to perform.The demand for perfection at Apple is relentless. While this has led to some ofthe most iconic products in the world, it also creates an atmosphere whereemployees often feel they are constantly walking on eggshells. Decisions arescrutinized at every level, and the need for approval from multiple layers ofmanagement can slow down even the simplest of tasks. This culture ofmicromanagement not only hinders creativity but also breeds a sense of distrust,where employees may hesitate to take initiative or think outside the box forfear of being second-guessed or reprimanded.\Toxicity in this environment often stems from the intense pressure to deliverresults, which can lead to a work culture that values output over well-being.The expectation to be “always on” creates a cycle of burnout that is difficultto break. Employees may find themselves working long hours, sacrificing personaltime, and constantly pushing beyond their limits, all while receiving littlerecognition or support. This not only affects morale but also takes a toll onmental health, creating an unsustainable work-life balance.Despite these challenges, the experience at Apple is a double-edged sword. Thebrand’s prestige and the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects areundeniable draws. However, it’s essential to acknowledge the less glamorous sideof the company culture—a side that can be draining and demoralizing, even forthe most passionate and dedicated professionals.Having said all that, after almost 4 years at the spaceship and workingwith some amazing people (some not ALL), I made decision back in October toleave Apple and look for someting else.New BeginningsI ended up taking a position at the first company I interviewed with. Most ofthe reasons are listed below but what isn’t mentioned below was the opportunityto work with some other ex-Apple folks that I respected a great deal as well asthe job being full remote. Not some bullshit RTO Mandate that involvedcommuting to Apple Park to manage a team that wasn’t in fact local.Joining GEICO as the Senior Director of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud SRE is anexciting new chapter in my career, one that comes at a pivotal moment for thecompany. GEICO is undergoing a significant transformation, shifting from atraditional IT organization to a forward-thinking Engineering organization. Thistransition is more than just a change in titles or processes—it’s a fundamentalreimagining of how we approach technology, problem-solving, and innovation.In the past, IT organizations have often been seen as reactive, primarilyfocused on maintaining systems and responding to issues as they arise. But asthe landscape of technology evolves, so too must our approach. At GEICO, we aremoving towards a model where engineering principles drive our decisions andstrategies. This shift means embracing a culture of continuous improvement,automation, and resilience. It’s about empowering teams to build, innovate, andtake ownership of their work, rather than just maintaining what already exists.As we transition to this new model, my role in Hybrid Cloud SRE will be crucial.We’re focusing on building robust, scalable, and highly available cloudenvironments that support our engineering teams and drive business outcomes.This involves not just adopting new technologies, but also fostering a mindsetwhere reliability, automation, and proactive problem-solving are at the core ofeverything we do. It’s an exciting time to be at GEICO, and I’m eager tocontribute to this transformation, helping to lead our teams into a future whereengineering excellence is the norm, not the exception.The journey ahead will undoubtedly come with its challenges, but it’s thesechallenges that make the transformation so rewarding. I’m looking forward tocollaborating with talented professionals across the company, leveraging ourcollective expertise to build something truly remarkable. This is more than justa job—it’s an opportunity to be part of a movement that will redefine how GEICOapproaches technology and engineering in the years to come.One More ThingTo quote Steve Jobs….So since the GEICO position was full remote and since we were looking for aplace to retire we ended up purchasing a house in BanderaTX. While it’s a pretty smalltown (under 900 people or so) and pretty remote we’re still only 25 minutes awayfrom Boerne and 40 minutes away from San Antonio.The bonus is we were able to get a house with a huge workshop for me and myprojects and the local electric co-operative also provided a 2gig fiber link tothe house (take that Silicon Valley). While we’re not selling the house in HalfMoon Bay anytime soon we are splitting time between the two houses (mostlyNicole and Patrick in CA).Well thanks for taking the time to read and here’s some gratuitious photos:Bandera House Photos",

      "content"  : "Returning to the world of blogging after nearly four years at Apple feels likerediscovering an old friend. The time away has been transformative, filled withincredible experiences, challenges, and growth. But as fulfilling as my work atApple was, it came with certain limitations—most notably, the company’s strictpolicies regarding personal expression online. Blogging, a platform I oncefreely embraced to share thoughts, ideas, and experiences, had to take abackseat due to these draconian rules.Apple’s approach to employee communication is well-known for its rigor. Thecompany prioritizes confidentiality and control over its narrative, which meansthat employees are often restricted from sharing their work or opinionspublicly. For someone who thrives on writing and sharing insights, this was atough adjustment. The rules are there for good reasons, protecting innovationand maintaining a unified message, but they also stifle personal expression,making it nearly impossible to keep up a blog without crossing lines.Now, as I step away from that chapter, I find myself eager to reconnect with theblogging community. The hiatus has given me new perspectives and a deeperunderstanding of technology, innovation, and the complexities of working withinsuch a tightly controlled environment. I’m excited to bring these insights intomy writing, blending my experiences at Apple with a renewed commitment to openand honest dialogue.Blogging again feels like a breath of fresh air—a chance to engage with ideasand conversations that were put on hold. I look forward to sharing more in thecoming weeks and months, exploring new topics, and reconnecting with readerswho, like me, value the freedom to express themselves openly.Anyways, more posts coming in the next few weeks talking about what I’m doingnext and where that’s happening.Cheers!",

      "content"  : "IntroductionI’ve been thinking about picking up some new 3d printers for awhile now as myFlashForge CreatorPros are starting toshow their age and one just doesn’t print at all anymore.Getting new printers (other than having a up-to-date platform) serves a fewpurposes for me.For one, Patrick is getting to the age (10) where he’s spending a lot of time onhis smartphone and in games. I hope to use 3d Printing to teach him new skills,empower his creativity, make family memories, and teach him a world of scienceand design.So I did a little bit of research and decided to go with a Creality Ender 3 S1Pro.Enter CrealityOverall, it’s been a great printer with regards to ease of unboxing/installationas well as the overall quality of the prints w/o any tuning whatsoever. It wastruly the easiest printer I’ve ever assembled. IIRC it was literally 11 bolts.Dead Simple.Some of the key features are:  Print size: 220 x 220 x 270 mm  Up to 300°C high-temp printing  Full-metal dual-gear direct extruder  CR-touch automatic leveling  4.3″ display  Easy to assembleWith regards to setup and tuning? Straight out of the box it’s an amazingprinter. Here are a couple of shots of it as well as some of the initial prints:                                    Gallery / Creality  Having said that, after doing some additional research I ended up reading a tonof reviews and watching many, many YouTube videos about the Bambu X1-Carbon. Dueto some of these reviews I bit the bullet and pulled the trigger on one.Enter BambuI purchased a Bambu X1-CarbonCombo on 7/17/2023 and itarrived via UPS on 7/20/2023. It sat in it’s box for a few days until I couldfind time for the assembly.The printer is shipped in a pretty large cardboard box, with foam protection onthe sides. The printer is packed well so I didn’t expect any kind of damageduring shipping. It can be easily taken out from the package by simply pullingfrom the sides of the plastic bag (But do take care here as plastic bags have atendency to rip and tear).While the printer comes pre-assembled (mostly); before you can start printingyou will need to remove a few screws that hold some parts in place duringshipping. If you purchased the AMS unit you will also need to remove it from theprinter’s enclosure via a few additional screws.You will also need to attach the touchscreen to the printer via a suppliedribbon cable.Overall the assembly process took longer than the Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro butwill still under an hour and signficantly easier that other printers that I’veowned in the past.Some of the Key features and improvements:  Large 256mm x 256mm x 256mm Build Volume  Compatible Printing Materials Up to 300°C  Built-In Camera Monitoring  Compatible with Abrasive Filaments (NylonX, NylonG, etc.)  Capable of Multi-Color and Multi-Material 3D Printing          Up to 16 colors printing        High quality printing with 7 μm Lidar Resolution  High speed CoreXY with 20000 mm/s² Acceleration  Dual Auto Bed Leveling  AI inspected first layer  Spaghetti failure detectionHere is some feedback and a few thoughts after owning the Bambu for a fewmonths.1) It’s very fast.Very very fast. I did a large sample print as a referencewall-honeycomb-part.stland the Bambu was approximately 240.63% faster than the Creality Ender 3 S1Pro.            Printer      Total Time      Time in Minutes                  Bambu      1h 36m      96              Creality      5h 27m      327      2) It’s slow.By this I mean it’s not slow at printing it’s slow at getting ready to print. Onaverage about 7.3% of the total print time is in setup or prep. i.e. homing thebed and leveling, checking resonance, calibrating input shaping and pressureadvance for extrusion. This also doesn’t account for bed and nozzle heating.3) Extruder/Hot End swapChanging the hotend/extruder on the Creality is as simple as grabbing a wrench,untightening the exiting nozzle and tightening the new nozzle. As Bambu uses acompletely integrated hotend/extruder it’s slightly more complicated. Here’s howthat works:Removal  Go to the Temperature/Axis settings and make sure your hotend temperature isat 30c or below, then turn the power OFF  Open the magnetic cover and move it aside  Gently remove the bigger 2-pin plug of the ceramic heater, the 4-pin plug ofthe cooling fan and the very small 2-pin plug of the thermistor  Use the H2 Allen key to unscrew the 2 screws that are near the top of thenozzles’ heatsink  Carefully and gently move the wires out of the plastic wire clip and removethe complete hotend assemblyInstallation  Position the complete hotend assembly so that the 2 screw holes will bebehind the bracket  Gently push the 2 screws in and then tighten them equally (but careful not toovertighten)  Plug in the bigger 2-pin ceramic heater plug, the 4-pin cooling fan plug, andthe very small 2-pin thermistor plug  Route all the loose cables through the plastic wire clip  Replace the magnetic cover… and you are done!!!As I said, slightly more complicated but not completely horrible.4) Build PlatesBy default the Bambu X1-C comes with both the Bambu Cool Plate and a BambuEngineering Plate which is going to require the use of a glue stick or painter’stape to ensure great adhesion. The Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro by default came witha spring steel textured PEI plate which is far superior. If you chose to pick upa Bambu X1-C then you should (at the time of purchase) add on a Bambu TexturedPEI Plate aswell. Trust me it’s worth the $37.99 USD.5) FilamentsThe Bambu X1-C comes with some starter filament. One of the things I love aboutthe AMS unit is the ability to read and register filament via RFID.Unfortunately this is only available through the use of Bambu Filaments.Initially the price of Bambu filaments versus say Polymaker there appears to bea $3 to $4 difference per kg. While this might be a problem for some I’ve notfound it to be a showstopper due to the aforementioned RFID tagging forfilament.A few other things to note is that once you have a few empty spools or order theempty spools from Bambu for the most part you should be ordered filament via therefill option which brings the prices inline with Polymaker. The process ofrefilling a spool takes 3-4 minutes and requires no tools or winders.Filament orders can only happen through the Bambu Store, there is no Amazonoption (booooooo) and shipping options (via FedEx) can take up to 10 days soplan accordingly. I think my second filament order was in the neighborhood of30kgs and somewhere around $750 USD but I didn’t have to order filament for afew more months.Final ThoughtsI liked my original Bambu X1-C so much that I ending up purchasing a second unitas well.I earnestly believe that the Bambu X1-C printer delivers commercial quality at aconsumer price point and it’s well worth the cost.Here is a photo gallery of some of the prints from the Bambu X1-C:                                                                            Gallery / Bambu X1-C Prints  I can certainly state the experience now days is significantly better than whenI put my first 3D Printer together, a Prusa Mendel that is show below.For reference that mendel was put together in 2011 and the printable parts wereprinted using a Makerbot Cupcake CNC from 2009.And now for some gratuitous photos of that Cupcake CNC                                          Gallery / Makerbot Cupcake CNC  ",

      "content"  : "Overview  Dual Universe is a first person based space simulation sandbox massivelymultiplayer online role play game (MMORPG) video game in development by theParis-based game development studio, Novaquark.For the last few years I’ve sunk an enormous amount of time playingDual Universe. Which for the most part I’vethoroughly enjoyed.It basically combined elements of games I’ve played for years now,Eve Online (released in 2003) andNo Man’s Sky (released in 2016). It alsoincorporates bits and pieces from Minecraft.Going through my email I was able to locate this one from August, 28th, 2019 or3 years ago to the day.  Hello Novean,  You recently signed up to create a Dual Universe account. To validate youremail, please click on the link below to finalize setting up your account.I’ve spent years invested in DU and have reported bugs and exploits over thattime. I’ve spent day’s on end in mining for resources (prior to automatic miningunits) just so that I could build Space Station’s and other bases on multipleplanets. I currently have 4 characters/accounts in-game and between the 4characters I have accumulated somewhere close to:  171m Talent Points  1.27b Quanta (in-game currency)The game launched in May 2016 in its pre-alpha state and entered Beta inAugust of 2020. The live release date for Dual Universe is 27 September 2022. The question of whether Dual Universe will wipe its servers at launch isone that has been hanging over players’ heads as far back as June when the devsat Novaquark openly ruminated about the decision.On August 9th, Novaquark announced that yes, there will be a full server resetat launch.Existing players will still retain their blueprints, friend lists, and guilddetails, while everything from planets to territories to constructs will bereset. This is being done for several reasons, including to give everyone evenfooting, better balance the economy, improve performance, and add new planets aswell as adjust existing ones.As a thank-you to beta testers, DU will be handing out Pioneer Packs full oftalent points, currency, and other materials in order to give players back someof their progress.PIONEER PACK - EXOTICThis package is available to players who have purchased at least thirteen monthsof subscription for the Dual Universe beta. Please note that it’s not necessaryto have used the game time by this date to qualify for this bracket.This package is also available to our Gold backers and above from ourcrowdfunding campaigns, as well as Sponsors and Patrons.  Up to 52,992,000 extra talent points, including the server-wide accelerator event and the beta talent point awards, by the end of the 6-month launch event.  6 monthly payments of 400,000 quanta.  5 Schematic copies of Dynamic Core Unit S  5 Schematic copies of Dynamic Core Unit M  5 Schematic copies of Dynamic Core Unit L  Tier 3 Rare Item - 1 Circinus collectible statue  3 exclusive decorative items: Deco potted plant white, Deco carpet, Deco potted plant blackTheresponseto the server reset by the players has been mixed at best.To be honest I’m not sure how I feel about the idea of the reset. From a gamebalancing standpoint I totally understand it. They want to ensure that the newplayers that will be joining for the first time on launch will not feeldisadvantaged. On the other hand, DU has been in beta for 2 years now and anyonecould have put down a credit card and started playing.The way the tiered-pioneer pack is setup, my 3 years of work during the betameans just as much as anyone that signs up today (for at least a 13 monthsubscription) will get the same pioneer pack as me and yet I’ve investedcountless more hours and money into DU. That’s some thank-you.To me this seems like a quick cash grab from Novaquark especially consideringthe game has been in development for 8 years (bleeding money) and also that atlaunch, the version launching is in many ways inferior to the version that’scurrently running as beta. Not all the planets that are currently in beta willbe launching. Some will be delayed for awhile. This will lead to some earlyinitial planets suffering from overcrowding and can potentially lead to wholeplanets becoming like Market 6 on Alioth back in the day.I think what’s most likely to happen is that I will continue to invest a littlebit of time into Dual Universe after launch but uncertain as to whether or not Iwill renew my subscriptions on expiration.It’s a real shame as DU had so much potential but for whatever reason neverquite reached it. I would respect NQ a hell of a lot more if they’d just comeout and state “hey we’re running out of cash and need to launch with a newinflux of cash and new players to ensure we can continue to develop DU”.Instead we get typical NQ marketing bullshit.",

      "content"  : "  Federal law requires all recreational flyers to pass an aeronautical knowledgeand safety test. The FAA developed The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)to meet this requirement.OverviewI’ve been working at a friends working ranch just outside of KerrvilleTexas since February under whatApple calls a Temporary Remote Working Arrangement.Several years ago I reached out to my buddy MichaelRollins with regardsto drones as the ranch owner wanted to purchase one to perform random tasks onthe property.I met Michael way back in 2004-2005 or so playing World ofWarcraft. Over the years we’ve become pretty goodfriends and one of his many hobbies has been flying and building drones.Based on Michael’s recommendation a DJI Phanton4was purchased.Drone TasksSome of the tasks that can be performed are:  surveying pastures  surveying fences  wildlife surveys  roof inspectionsIn pasture surveying, aerial technology lets ranchers easily map plant height,plant health, monitor weather damage as well as irrigation across theirproperties, so that they can take immediate action when issues arise. This willgenerally require additional 3rd party sensors and software.Fencing is an area of ranching that frequently requires a lot of attention andupkeep. Previous to drone technology, workers would survey the perimeter of theranch to ensure the fence was still intact. A broken fence causes issues likeallowing animals to escape, providing easy access inside to hunters, or mixinglivestock with neighbors. By using software features like Live Map, ranchers canpinpoint the affected areas before physically arriving with their tools. Notonly does this cut down on time, but it’s also a more reliable method thanout-of-date or cloudy satellite imagery.Utilizing a drone for wildlife surveys is more accurate and consistent comparedto alternatives like manned aviation or physically walking the property. One canfly lower than manned aviation to get higher quality images and be moretransparent than a team physically walking around the property.Drone Training and UseAs a recreational drone pilot you need to understand some basic rules and getcertified by taking The Recreational UASSafety Test(TRUST).TRUST stands for The Recreational UAS Safety Test. It provides education andtesting for recreational drone flyers on important safety and regulatoryinformation. If you fly your drone recreationally under the Exception forRecreational Flyers, you must pass the test before you fly. Federal law requiresall recreational flyers to pass an aeronautical knowledge and safety test. TheFAA developed The Recreational UAS Safety Test to meet this requirement.TRUST is free, can be taken online through a variety of FAA-approved testadministrators, and typically takes 30 minutes or less to complete. After youpass the test, you will receive a completion certificate. Be sure to keep thiscertificate with you when you fly your drone, either in paper or electronicformat. Test administrators will not keep a record of your completioncertificate, therefore if you lose your certificate, you need re-take the TRUST.The below organizations have all been approved by the FAA to administer theTRUST as of April 2022:  Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA)  Boy Scouts of America  Chippewa Valley Technical College  Community College of Allegheny County – West Hills Center  CrossFlight Sky Solutions  Drone Launch Academy LLC  Drone Trust  Drone U  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)  HSU Educational Foundation  Lake Area Technical College  New College Institute (NCI)  Pilot Institute  Proctorio Incorporated  Tactical Aviation  UAV Coach  University of Arizona Global Campus  Volatus Aerospace CorpBasic Rules  you must fly your drone within visual line of sight  stay below 400ft altitude  stay at least 5 miles away from an airport that might have a Part 107 requirement  flight operations during daylight hours only.There are also a few additional rules:  All drones must be registered, except those that weigh 0.55 pounds or less(less than 250 grams) and are flown exclusively under the Exception forRecreational Flyers.  Drones registered under part 107 may be flown for recreational purposes aswell as under part 107.  Drones registered under the Exception for Recreational Flyers cannot be flownfor Part 107 operations.Because the DJI Phantom 4 weighs 1380 grams I needed to register the drone withthe FAA.How to RegisterInformation Needed to Register  Physical address and mailing address (if different from physical address)  Email address  Phone number  Make and model of your drone  Specific Remote ID serial number provided by the manufacturer (if applicable)  Credit or debit cardRegistration Fees  Part 107 registration costs $5 per drone and is valid for three (3) years.  The Exception for Recreational Flyers registration costs $5 and is valid forthree (3) years.  Once registered, drone registration cannot be transferred between types (part107 or the Exception for Recreational Flyers).Registration Requirements  13 years of age or older (if the owner is less than 13 years of age, a person13 years of age or older must register the drone)  A U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident.  For foreign operators, FAA will consider the certificate issued to be arecognition of ownership rather than a certificate of U.S. aircraftregistration.After you RegisterOnce you register your drone, you will receive an FAA registration certificate.You must have your registration certificate (either a paper copy or digitalcopy) in your possession when you fly. If another individual operates yourdrone, they must have your drone registration certificate (either a paper ordigital copy) in their possession. Federal law requires drone operators whoare required to register, to show their certificate of registration to anyFederal, State, or local law enforcement officer if asked.Failure to register a drone that requires registration may result in regulatoryand criminal penalties. The FAA may assess civil penalties up to $27,500.Criminal penalties include fines of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up tothree (3) years.The FAA requires that you mark all drones with your registration number beforeyou fly them. Here is how to label your drone:  Must be maintained in a condition that is legible.  Must be affixed to the small unmanned aircraft by any means necessary toensure that it will remain affixed for the duration of each operation.  Must be legibly displayed on an external surface of the small unmannedaircraft.ConclusionIn conclusion the steps you need to take to safely operate your drone and remainwithin legal compliance isn’t all that hard to do.Random PhotosHere are a few shots that I was able to get on my first few flights.

Pat McDonnellSo this security camera footage was captured earlier this week approximately a1/2 mile from my house. As such I thought it was time to write a post in regardsto Mountain Lions.California Mountain LionsMore than half of California is mountain lion habitat. Mountain lions generallyexist wherever deer are found. They are solitary and elusive, and their natureis to avoid humans.Mountain lions primarily eat deer, but, if allowed, they will prey on vulnerablepets and livestock. In extremely rare cases, even people have fallen prey tomountain lions.Mountain lions that threaten people are immediately killed. Those that prey onpets or livestock can be killed by a property owner after the required permit issecured. Moving problem mountain lions is not an option. It causes deadlyterritorial conflicts with other mountain lions already there. Or the relocatedmountain lion returns.Living in Mountain Lion Country  Acknowledge that you live in mountain lion country and make a commitment toeducate yourself. Talk to your neighbors and work together.  Never feed deer or other wildlife; it is illegal to feed deer and other biggame in California and it will attract mountain lions.  Deer-proof your landscaping by avoiding plants that deer like to eat.  Trim brush to reduce hiding places for mountain lions.  Don’t leave small children or pets outside unattended.  Install motion-sensitive lighting around the house.  Provide sturdy, covered shelters for sheep, goats, and other vulnerableanimals.  Don’t allow pets outside when mountain lions are most active—dawn, dusk, andat night.  Bring pet food inside to avoid attracting raccoons, opossums and otherpotential mountain lion prey.What to do if you Encounter a Mountain LionMountain lions are quiet, solitary and elusive, and typically avoid people bynature. However, as human population expands into mountain lion habitat, morefrequent sightings may occur and human/mountain lion encounters may increase.Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare. However, attacks haveoccurred in California. Understanding mountain lion behavior and how to actresponsibly in mountain lion country may greatly reduce potential conflict withthese majestic animals.The following safety information is a compilation taken from wildlife managers,wildlife officers and scientists that study mountain lion behavior. Although nostrategy in the event of an encounter is guaranteed to be successful in everysituation, these tips will help keep you safe in lion country.  Do not hike, bike, or jog alone. Stay alert on trails.  Avoid hiking or jogging when mountain lions are most active – dawn, dusk, andat night.  Keep a close watch on small children.  Off leash dogs on trails are at increased risk of becoming prey for amountain lion.  Never approach a mountain lion. Give them an escape route.  DO NOT RUN. Stay calm. Running may trigger chase, catch and kill response. Donot turn your back. Face the animal, make noise and try to look bigger bywaving your arms, or opening your jacket if wearing one; throw rocks or otherobjects. Pick up small children.  Do not crouch down or bend over. Squatting puts you in a vulnerable positionof appearing much like a 4-legged prey animal.  Be vocal; however, speak calmly and do not use high pitched tones or highpitch screams.  Teach others how to behave during an encounter. Anyone who runs may initiatean attack.  Carry and know how to use bear spray to deter a mountain lion. Bear spray hasbeen shown to be successful in emergency situations with mountain lions. Havethe spray readily accessible. Carry in a holster belt or attach to a mountainbike. Talk to the folks at your local outdoor store. Make sure you know how toproperly use bear spray. People have been known to spray their own faces whenattempting to use it.  If a lion attacks, fight back. Research on mountain lion attacks suggests thatmany potential victims have fought back successfully with rocks, sticks,garden tools, even an ink pen or bare hands. Try to stay on your feet. Ifknocked down, try to protect head and neck.  If a mountain lion attacks a person, immediately call 911.  Report unusual mountain lion behavior to your local CDFW regional office.",

Theodore Roosevelt President of the United States (#26)In this I promise to never spam you or sell your email address. The only reasonthe address is collected is to notify you of winning. Once the contest is overthe data collected on all users will be deleted.latest blog post regardingconservation I’d like to talk to you about the Rocky Mountain ElkFoundation, their history, what they do and how they doit.The mission of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation is to ensure the future of elkother wildlife, their habitat and our hunting heritage.In support of their mission, the RMEF is committed to:  conserving, restoring and enhancing natural habitats  promoting the sound management of wild elk, which may be hunted or otherwiseenjoyed  restoring elk to their native ranges  educating members and the public about habitat conservation and our huntingheritage.RMEF HistoryRocky Mountain Elk Foundation founders, left to right: Bob Munson, Dan Bull, Bill Munson and Charlie DeckerIn 1984, four hunters from Northwest Montana recognized a handful oforganizations doing great work for species like ducks, turkeys and upland birds.They also recognized there was no group dedicated to North America’s grandestbig game animal, elk. In May of that year, they pooled their time, talent andresources and created the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, an organizationdedicated to elk, elk hunting and the habitat they need to thrive.Hard Work Pays OffThey set up shop in the back room of a trailer house in Troy, the four; apastor,a realtor, a logger and a drive-in owner, created an organization thatwould directly benefit elk and other wildlife by putting money to work on theground. The team drained their bank accounts and borrowed funds to mail out43,000 brochures soliciting members, promising a subscription to a magazineabout elk and elk hunting, as well as an annual international convention.They received a dismal 233 responses. But they believed they’d made a commitmentto these people. So they borrowed additional funds and printed 32,000 copies ofthe premier issue of Bugle magazine, which they mailed out and time, hard workand patience, but by the end of 1984, membership had grown to almost 2,500.The First of Many Successes to ComeIn April 1985, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation held their first convention inSpokane, Washington. They also funded their first habitat project that year, agrant to help fund a prescribed burn in a place fittingly named Elk Creek on theKootenai National Forest near Libby, Montana. In 1988, they facilitated theirfirst land acquisition, the 16,440-acre Robb Creek property in Montana, andreceived their first ringing endorsement from the corporate community. At theirannual convention that year, Ray Goff, former RMEF board member and VicePresident of Anheuser-Busch, announced a $500,000 gift from the company. Thatgift helped kick off their incredible growth and conservation achievements.Bursting at the SeamsBy 1988, the RMEF staff had grown to 12, and their offices were spread across avacant dentist’s office, a mini mall and an abandoned grocery store. They nowhad 32,000 members, 2,000 passionate volunteers and 70 chapters, and they hadprotected and enhanced more than 110,000 acres of elk country. Bursting at theseams, it was time to say goodbye to the RMEF’s birthplace and move to Missoula,Montana.A Shining StarSince then, they’ve grown to more than 227,000 members whose support hasprotected and enhanced more than 7.3 million acres of North American wildlifehabitat. Hundreds of thousands of these acres were completely off-limits to thepublic. They are now open for all to hunt, fish and otherwise enjoy. They employmore than 120 people and boast more than 11,000 volunteers working through morethan 500 chapters across the United States.From the most humble beginnings in 1984, the RMEF has risen to become one of themost effective and efficient conservation organizations in the United States.Today, working together with members, volunteers, and partners as Team Elk, theRMEF is striving to conserve the next million acres of elk country, and to be astrong voice for hunters, access, and wildlife management and conservationissues.How They ConserveLand ProtectionThe RMEF permanently protects crucial elk winter and summer ranges, migrationcorridors, calving grounds and other vital areas, while focusing on securing andimproving hunter access throughout elk country. Their land conservation toolsinclude: acquisitions, access agreements and easements, conservation easements,land and real estate donations, land exchanges and associated acres.Habitat StewardshipHealthy habitat is essential for healthy elk and other wildlife. The RMEF helpsfund and conduct a variety of projects to improve essential forage, water, coverand space components of wildlife habitat, and supports research and managementefforts to help maintain productive elk herds and habitat.Elk RestorationThe RMEF works to reestablish elk herds in historic ranges where the habitat andhuman cultural tolerance create a high potential for self-sustaining herds.Land Protection ProgramsSince 1984, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has permanently protected morethan 1,700 square miles of prime habitat for elk and other wildlife across thecountry.The RMEF uses advanced habitat mapping technology (GIS) to identify andprioritize the most crucial elk winter and summer ranges, migration corridorsand calving areas. They then work with their partners, including willinglandowners, government agencies, corporations, foundations and otherconservation groups to permanently protect the most critical habitat and targetareas for public access. Their land conservation tools include: landacquisitions, conservation easements, access agreements and easements, land andreal estate donations, contributions, land exchanges and associated acres.Their goals are to permanently protect the most critical elk habitat and toincrease public access opportunities.Land AcquisitionsThe RMEF purchases key elk habitat to protect wildlife values. In most cases,they do not retain ownership. Most often, they convey it to a federal or statemanagement agency (state wildlife department, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau ofLand Management, etc.). The agency then acts as a steward of the land,protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat, while providing the public increasedrecreational opportunities, including hunting and fishing.Conservation EasementsA conservation easement protects wildlife habitat on private property. It is avoluntary legal agreement with a landowner to protect their land in perpetuityfrom development and other uses that could diminish its wildlife habitat valuesbut still allows for many traditional uses of the land. The land remains inprivate ownership and in many instances the landowner may qualify for taxbenefits. Although it is not required, the RMEF encourages landowners to allowpublic access.Land and Real Estate DonationsDonating land for conservation purposes is one of the finest legacies a personcan leave to future generations. The RMEF may accept donations of land or realestate from private individuals or corporations. Depending on the type of realestate, they may retain ownership, convey the property to a private citizen(after protecting it with a conservation easement), state, or federal agency,or, if the property lacks significant habitat values, sell the donated propertyand use the proceeds to protect land with important wildlife values.ContributionsThe RMEF may provide funding to state or federal agencies or another nonprofitorganization to assist them with their wildlife habitat protection or publicaccess efforts. Their contributions often generate additional habitat dollarsfrom matching grant programs.Land ExchangesThe RMEF may assist a government agency or a private landowner in exchanginglands. These exchanges typically take place when an agency has wildlife habitatlands it wants to acquire. Many exchanges will result in an increase of landsthat are open for the public to enjoy.Associated AcresWhen the RMEF protects land, those benefits often extend to associated, leasedgrazing lands connected to the acquisition. This often results in additionalbenefits to wildlife through improved grazing systems and livestockredistribution.Habitat Stewardship ProgramsProviding high quality habitat (food, water, cover and space) is key to ensuringthe future of elk and other wildlife. Research and management projects helpmanage elk in ways that guarantee productive herds and provide hunteropportunity.Habitat Stewardship Program ElementsThe RMEF’s Habitat Stewardship Program is comprised of three elements: habitatenhancement, wildlife management and research. Financial support for theprogram comes from RMEF volunteers who raise funds through local chapter eventsfor project grants. The RMEF then works with biologists and land managers tofund projects that will provide wildlife the best bang for the buck.Ensuring a Future for ElkThe RMEF helps ensure that North America’s elk will remain abundant and healthy  by working with federal, state, provincial and tribal land managers as well asprivate landowners to restore healthy habitat on public and private lands  by supporting management and research efforts by state and provincialagencies, universities and private organizationsHabitat EnhancementFire suppression, invasive weeds, conifer encroachment and drought all degradeelk habitat. Some, like drought, are just nature’s way. Others, like firesuppression and weeds, are a direct result of human actions. Using tools such asprescribed burning, thinning, fertilization, seeding, water developments,noxious weed treatments and fencing, they are reversing the effects of theseimpacts on elk country. Many of their projects enhance habitat on public andprivate lands where elk already exist; some are designed to encourage elk tomove onto public lands and away from ranchers’ crops and haystacks.Wildlife ManagementProviding grants for studies and tools such as new elk census techniques, andtelemetry studies to determine habitat use and migration routes, are other waysthat the RMEF helps wildlife managers enhance and maintain wild, free-rangingelk populations.ResearchThe RMEF understands that the future of our wild elk herds depends on goodscience. Funding projects that research critical factors such as nutritionalneeds of elk, predation and disease provides biologists with sound, scientificdata for effective wildlife and habitat management.Elk Restoration ProgramsThere is perhaps no higher calling for a conservation organization than torestore extirpated wildlife species back to their historic ranges.Feasibility StudiesWith that in mind, in 1990 the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation began fundingfeasibility studies to determine if wild, free-ranging elk still had a place insome of their former eastern habitats. Partnering with state wildlife agenciesand universities, they asked three important questions:  Can the habitat support elk?  How will restoring elk affect the local economy and hunting?  And finally, will local citizens accept a restored elk herd?Repopulating Historic RangeOnce a feasibility study is completed and a restoration project is approved bythe state wildlife agency and affected landowners, the RMEF and its volunteershelp trap and transfer wild elk from a source herd to their ancestral grounds.All elk trapped are tested for seven diseases, including brucellosis andbluetongue, before leaving the trap site. Healthy source herds have been used inArizona, Kansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and Alberta’s Elk IslandNational Park.Monitoring Ensures SuccessOnce elk reach their new destination, it’s up to the participating wildlifeagency to decide whether they are held in acclimation pens for a few months orreleased directly into the wild. Regardless, after they hit the ground the elkare monitored for three to five years to study such things as movement patternsand calf survival to ensure proper management of the herd and their habitat.Restoration Efforts So FarRMEF helped launch successful elk restorations in Wisconsin in 1995, Kentucky in1997, Tennessee in 2000, Ontario in 1998, the Great Smoky Mountains NationalPark in 2001, Missouri in 2011, Virginia in 2012 and West Virginia in 2016. Inaddition, RMEF has funded completed feasibility studies in Illinois, Maryland,New York and West Virginia. The state agencies use the study data to determinewhether or not to restore elk to their respective state.A Benefit to People and EconomiesToday, wild, free-ranging elk are making tracks in places where they haven’t formore than a century. Local economies benefit from visitors who travel from allover to catch a glimpse of the wily wapiti. In 2001, Kentucky held its first elkhunt in 150 years, and Pennsylvania its first hunt in more than 70 years. In2009, Tennessee also held its first elk hunt in 150 years. As Eastern elk herdscontinue to prosper, the RMEF, its volunteers and partners will be there towelcome calves born beneath the hardwoods, and hear bulls’ bugles echoing acrossmountains and through hollows.To Learn More about the Successful Elk Restorations please visit:  Wisconsin  Ontario  Kentucky  Tennessee  Great Smoky Mountains National Park  Missouri  Virginia  West VirginiaAdditional Stats  Acres Protected and Enhanced          More than 7.4 million acres        Number of Acres Opened and/or Secured for Public Access for Hunting and OtherOutdoor Recreation          More than 1.2 million acres opened and/or secured        Number of Permanent Land Protection, Habitat Stewardship, Elk Restoration,Conservation Education and Hunting Heritage Projects          More than 11,818 projects        Number of Members          More than 234,000        Number of Chapters          More than 500 in the United States        Number of Volunteers          More than 12,000      Giveaway DetailsI’m giving away 3 annual supporting membership to the Rocky Mountain ElkFoundation.

The land ethic simplyenlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants andanimals, or collectively the land.  Aldo LeopoldPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a massive package of public landslegislation made up of more than 100 individual bills that were introduced by 50senators and several U.S. House members.Those include measures to:  Permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with key reformsto strengthen its state-side program;  Increase access and opportunities for hunting, fishing, and other outdoorrecreational activities on federal lands;  Provide for economic development in dozens of communities through landexchanges and conveyances;  Improve western water management by increasing local control, promotinginvestment, and facilitating the recovery of endangered species; and  Conserve treasured landscapes in communities, where such designations arelocally supported.Formerly known as the Natural Resources Management Act, the bipartisan bill,S. 47, was renamed the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management andRecreation Act in honor ofDingell, a long-serving member ofCongress who died last month at the age of 92.President Trump knows that federal lands are meant to provide both peace andprosperity for the American people, and signing this bill allows us to continuemanaging public lands in a balanced way,” David Bernhardt, acting Department ofInterior secretary, said in a statement 1. “This bill is extremely beneficialto the American people, and I look forward to working with Congress and localcommunities to implement the many local conservation wins within the bill.”Highlights of the bill include permanent reauthorization of the Land and WaterConservation Fund, expanded hunting and fishing opportunities on dozens ofnational wildlife refuges and thousands more acres of other public lands, and aprovision allowing archery hunters to carry unarmed bows across National ParkService land.In a news release 2, U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the bill also“advances important North Dakota priorities.” Among those priorities, the billstreamlines the process for transferring titles from the Bureau of Reclamationto local authorities, said Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and NaturalResources Committee. That aligns with legislation Hoeven introduced to transferthe title for the Oakes Test Area to the Dickey-Sargent Irrigation District inthe southeast part of the state.The bill also includes legislation Hoeven and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.,introduced to improve and expand the North Country Scenic Trail, which runs fromNew York to North Dakota.The grassroots group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers called Tuesday’s signing ofthe bill a “significant victory for public lands sportsmen and women.”“Together, the public lands grassroots nation rose up to ensure the passage ofthis historic bill,” Land Tawney, BHA president and CEO, said in a statement3. “We wrote letters, we made phone calls, we met with our elected officialsand we traveled from across the country to Washington, D.C., and together wemade our voices heard. Today, we can celebrate a victory that has been years inthe making.”Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy and NaturalResources Committee, said the president’s effort to achieve U.S. energydominance while working with Congress to create a conservation legacy “exceedsthe accomplishments of his recent predecessors” with the signing of the landspackage.“This law will benefit every state and clear the deck of issues that we’ve beenworking to resolve for years,” Murkowski said in a statement 4. “Fromproviding access for sportsmen to creating new economic opportunities for localcommunities, this is a good, balanced measure. We built it through a team effortthat drew strong support from both parties in both chambers. Today is a triumphfor good process and good policy, and this bill is a win for Alaskans and allAmericans.”Additional Reading  “S. 47 — 116th Congress: John D.

Aldo LeopoldA vote by the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday supported a massivepackage of conservation and public access bills that permanently reauthorizesthe Land and Water Conservation Fund and advances other key measures, edginghunters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts closer to a hard-won andlong-awaited victory. The legislation now heads to the president’s desk.This is the most sweeping conservation leglislation in over a decade, protectingmillions of acres of land and hundreds of miles of wild rivers.The Natural Resources Management Act (S. 47)1 encompasses the consensuspriorities of sportsmen and women as well as a bipartisan cadre of senators whohave worked to ensure the legislation’s survival. Senate Majority Leader MitchMcConnell’s (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) and Sen. LisaMurkowski’s (R-AK) ongoing efforts that began last Congress paid off withtoday’s overwhelming 363-62 with 6 non-votes2 vote in support of the measure.The House vote was a resounding affirmation of bipartisan support for thelegislation. The bill includes measures sought by lawmakers from most everystate, including a smattering of pet projects, and might also be an indicationthat to reach broad consensus in Washington, D.C., the sausage-making requires aserving or two of locally sourced pork.The House passed the bill, under suspension of its rules, which means itrequired a two-thirds vote of approval.Key features of S. 47 include:  Permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund with 3percent dedicated to securing hunting and fishing access opportunities onpublic lands and waters.  Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area.  Methow Valley permanent mineral withdrawal.  California Desert Protection and Recreation Act.  Cerro del Yuta and Rio San Antonio wilderness areas.  Reauthorization of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Partners for Fish andWildlife program at current funding levels of $51.6 million until FY2022.  Reauthorization of Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act at $6.5 millionuntil FY2022, a $2.6 million increase of funding from currently enactedlevels.  Authorization for hunters with archery equipment to cross National ParkService lands by foot or horseback.“The masses are awakening, and the public lands revolution is growing,”Backcountry Hunters &amp;Anglers President andCEO Land Tawney said. “Today’s vote by the House of Representatives, coming onthe heels of the Senate’s overwhelming support of S. 47 earlier this month,proves without a doubt that citizens’ voices do count and our nation’scongressional leaders can come together to advance meaningful bipartisanlegislation.”The act’s passage through theSenateand now the House comes at a time when politics are particularly contentious andsplit. But because it touches on all 50 states and appeases environmentalists,anglers, sportsmen, and every other variety of recreationists, the legislationreceived support from both sides of the aisle, with little debate on the Housefloor.Voting BreakdownAs mentioned earlier the voting was 363-62 with 6 non-votes.Footnotes            S.47 - Natural Resources Management Act &#8617;              How they voted &#8617;      ",

It is built on a base of onion, carrot and celery.Nor does it have lots of herbs in it. The sauce contains dairy products. Andtomato, while present, is not the star of the sauce. The meat is. And to make areal Bolognese, it must cook a long, long time.As with most wild game recipes, I have tweaked the classic just a bit to make itwork with elk. Since elk is leaner than the traditional mixture of ground beefchuck and ground pork in most Bolognese sauce recipes, I add a bit of fat in theform of diced bacon (although one could use pancetta). The bacon itself breaksdown during the relatively long cooking time, so you don’t really notice it inthe final dish, but the flavor and texture that the small amount of pork fatreally adds to the dish.Ingredients  2 pounds ground elk  6-8 slices bacon (diced) (pancetta could also be used here)  1 medium onion (finely chopped)  1 stalk celery (finely chopped)  1 large carrot (finely chopped)  1 shallot (finely chopped)  4 cloves garlic (minced)  4 tablespoons butter  4 tablespoons olive oil  2 tablespoons tomato paste  1 cup beef broth  1 cup dry red wine  1 can (28 ounce) San Marzano tomatoes (crushed)  1-2 bay leaf  1 teaspoon salt  1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper  1 tablespoon dried oregano  1 tablespoon dried basil  3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  1 cup whole milk or cream (you will need to use double cream to prevent anyseparating (48–60% fat content) )  1 ½ pounds dry Tagliatelle pastaParmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano cheese for gratingInstructionsPrep WorkStart by either chopping or dicing your basic ingredients.

I also portion out my dryingredients in small stainless steel portion cups.Prep Work Done.Cooking InstructionsStart by adding the olive oil and diced bacon to a heavy pot (an enameled castiron pot is perfect) using medium heat. Render the bacon (or pancetta) untilcrisp. Next add the diced onion, carrot, celery and shallot and cook forapproximately fifteen minutes, stirring often.Add the ground elk and cook till it is browned through, this should take about15 minutes. Add the garlic and raise the heat to medium-high then add the wineand beef broth. Cook sauce until wine and broth are mostly evaporated.Turn down the heat to a simmer and add oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and redpepper flakes. Let this cook for approximately 20 minutes. Now add the crushedtomatoes and tomato paste and bring heat up until you have a boil. After a fewminutes, reduce the heat to a simmer.Let the sauce simmer (very slowly) partially covered for about 2 to 4 hours (thelonger the better), do stir occasionally to prevent sticking.Bolognese is done.About 5 to 10 minutes before serving, add milk or cream and butter.Just before the sauce is finished, bring one gallon of water to a boil, add twotablespoons of salt and the pasta. Cook for eight to 10 minutes or until thepasta is al dente. Top with the bolognese sauce and cheese just before serving.The Final Product.",

      "content"  : "  I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use thenatural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the right to waste them,or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.  Theodore Roosevelt President of the United States (#26)Hunting and Conservation  My views on Conservation have been formed by actively hunting, fishing, andspending time in the outdoors for close to 45 years now.  meIn our nation’s early years, there were few laws protecting fish and wildlifeand our wildlife resources took a heavy toll. Market hunters took fish andwildlife at will while habitat disappeared under plow and roads, resultingin devastating reductions in wildlife populations. Some species, like thepassenger pigeon, were taken to the point of no return; others such as bison,white-tailed deer and wild turkeys, were pushed to the edge extinction.As the tides turned for conservation, important laws were passed, including theMigratory Bird Treaty Act of1918, theMigratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act of1934, and the Federal Aid inSport Fish Restoration Act of1950. Collectively,these acts laid the foundation for what inspired the North American Model ofWildlife Conservation.North American Model of Wildlife ConservationAcross North America, hunting was a largely unregulated activity for individualsand commercial entities until the 1800’s, when citizens began to ask whetherwildlife populations could continue at healthy levels without checks on hunting.The legal framework that has since developed grew out of a set of principles nowknown as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation. Seven featuresmake the North American model distinct.  Wildlife is a public resource. In the Unites States, wildlife is considered a public resource, independent of the land or water where wildlife may live. Government at various levels have a role in managing that resource on behalf of all citizens and to ensure the long-term sustainability of wildlife populations.  Markets for game are eliminated. Before wildlife protection laws were enacted, commercial operations decimated populations of many species. Making it illegal to buy and sell meat and parts of game and nongame species removed a huge threat to the survival of those species. A market in furbearers continues as a highly regulated activity, often to manage invasive wildlife.  Allocation of wildlife by law. Wildlife is a public resource managed by government. As a result, access to wildlife for hunting is through legal mechanisms such as set hunting seasons, bag limits, license requirements, etc.  Wildlife can only be killed for a legitimate purpose. Wildlife is a shared resource that must not be wasted. The law prohibits killing wildlife for frivolous reasons.  Wildlife is an international resource. Some species, such as migratory birds cross international boundaries. Treaties such as the Migratory Bird Treaty and CITES recognize a shared responsibility to manage these species across national boundaries.  Science is the proper tool for discharge of wildlife policy. In order to manage wildlife as a shared resource fairly, objectively, and knowledgeably, decisions must be based on sound science such as annual waterfowl population surveys and the work of professional wildlife biologists.  The democracy of hunting. In keeping with democratic principles, government allocates access to wildlife without regard for wealth, prestige, or land ownership.Carrying on the theme above here are 5 fairly concrete examples of howhunting/sportsmen work(s) in conjunction with Conservation.  In 1907, only 41,000 elk remained in North America. Thanks to the money and hard work invested by hunters to restore and conserve habitat, today there are more than 1 million.  In 1900, only 500,000 whitetails remained. Thanks to conservation work spearheaded by hunters, today there are more than 32 million.  In 1900, only 100,000 wild turkeys remained. Thanks to hunters, today there are over 7 million.  In 1901, few ducks remained. Thanks to hunters’ efforts to restore and conserve wetlands, today there are more than 44 million.  In 1950, only 12,000 pronghorn remained. Thanks to hunters, today there are more than 1.1 million.The 5 species listed above were almost completely wiped out to to market huntingand really only came back due to the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of1937.This law, commonly referred to the Pittman-Robertson Act created an excise taxthat provides funds to each state to manage such animals and their habitats.The Pittman-Robertson Act (P-R) increased an existing 10-percent gun-and-bullettax by one percent and dedicated the proceeds to the USFWS to apportion tostates during a time when Congress was slashing taxes. It has generated morethan $11 billion for conservation since 1939.One of the P-R’s greatest strengths is its $3-to-$1 federal-state match, whichrequires states to pony up $1 for every three federal grant dollars. Thispractice discourages state legislators from sweeping revenues generated bylicenses and fees—which are state wildlife agencies’ primary source offunding—into the general fund.Instead of going into the U.S. Treasury as it had done in the past, the money iskept separate and is given to the Secretary of the Interior to distribute to theStates. The Secretary determines how much to give to each state based on aformula that takes into account both the area of the state and its number oflicensed hunters.So how much money does this actually mean? Well here are the breakdowns for 2018when you combine the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937 with theFederal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 1.                                                    STATE      TOTAL - SPORT FISH RESTORATION (FY18)      TOTAL - ALL WILDLIFE FUNDS (FY18)      TOTAL - ALL FUNDS (FY18)              ALABAMA      $6,151,179      $19,360,421      $25,511,600              ALASKA      $17,595,874      $33,455,771      $51,051,645              AMERICAN SAMOA      $1,173,058      $1,328,563      $2,501,621              ARIZONA      $7,154,503      $22,080,003      $29,234,506              ARKANSAS      $5,348,981      $13,221,723      $18,570,704              CALIFORNIA      $16,513,733      $26,037,993      $42,551,726              COLORADO      $9,143,673      $19,872,123      $29,015,796              CONNECTICUT      $3,519,175      $5,901,190      $9,420,365              DELAWARE      $3,519,175      $4,785,824      $8,304,999              DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA      $1,173,058      $0      $1,173,058              FLORIDA      $12,236,611      $14,351,398      $26,588,009              GEORGIA      $8,041,424      $23,213,465      $31,254,889              GUAM      $1,173,058      $1,328,563      $2,501,621              HAWAII      $3,519,175      $4,785,824      $8,304,999              IDAHO      $6,430,284      $15,474,320      $21,904,604              ILLINOIS      $6,593,209      $16,335,080      $22,928,289              INDIANA      $4,577,731      $13,573,699      $18,151,430              IOWA      $4,513,130      $11,515,178      $16,028,308              KANSAS      $4,981,927      $14,646,057      $19,627,984              KENTUCKY      $5,198,763      $14,127,290      $19,326,053              LOUISIANA      $6,908,171      $15,884,383      $22,792,554              MAINE      $3,519,175      $8,055,283      $11,574,458              MARYLAND      $3,519,175      $7,754,551      $11,273,726              MASSACHUSETTS      $3,519,175      $7,986,372      $11,505,547              MICHIGAN      $10,692,452      $24,296,525      $34,988,977              MINNESOTA      $12,500,370      $23,400,370      $35,900,740              MISSISSIPPI      $4,009,209      $12,144,757      $16,153,966              MISSOURI      $7,677,750      $21,117,103      $28,794,853              MONTANA      $8,648,987      $21,131,270      $29,780,257              N.

Which comes to approximately $10 billion inspending by sportsmen.In comparison, in 2017 the Sierra Club received $68 million dollars in totalcontributions and spent $63 million dollars on program services. Essentiallysportsmen from Michigan and North Carolina combined contributed the sameamount as the Sierra Club in total. I’m not trying to paint the Sierra Club as abad organization at all. They simply just can’t do enough.Since the first annual apportionment of $890,000 in 1939 by the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service (USFWS), the agency has distributed more than $21 billion fromthe two federal excise taxes for state conservation and recreation projects.This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 2009 to 2018.(Data via USFWS)Buying licenses, stamps and tags to legally hunt or fish in America is anessential and necessary means to supporting wildlife conservation. As a matterof record the recipient state wildlife agencies have matched these funds withapproximately $6.7 billion throughout the years, primarily through those huntingand fishing license revenues.Next StepsExpanding the Excise TaxSo how can we as sportsmen increase that number? Well, for one, if the excisetax provided by the Pittman-Robertson act was increased to 15% then that wouldraise the total amount to $1.5 billion annually. Seems pretty straight forward.Some experts think it’s time to expand P-R taxes to more hunting andshooting-related products.Whit Fosburgh, president and CEO of the Teddy Roosevelt ConservationPartnership, thinks hunters should lobby to get itemssuch as treestands, reloading equipment, powder, and primers included in P-R toincrease the revenues that give them leverage in influencing conservationpolicy.Whitney Tilt a consultant on natural resource conservation wrote a post 2over on PERC — the Property and Environment ResearchCenter asking whether or not should mountain bikers,kayakers, and other recreationalists pay an excise tax to help fund outdoorrecreation?This in essence would extend the P-R tax to “outdoor products you can buy at REI— bicycles, camping gear, tents and following that P-R model” would benefiteveryone, especially wildlife.Passing New LegislationCurrently, there are three bills currently making their way through thelegislative branch that would dedicate more money both directly, and indirectly,to hunting and shooting sports.They are:HR 788 - The Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support ActSponsored by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, this would allow P-R funds to payup to 90 percent, rather than the current 75 percent, of costs in acquiring landfor expanding, or constructing, public shooting ranges. It would also lower theP-R match to 10 percent.By lowering the P-R match to 10 percent, it also gives states more ability toaward grants for shooting ranges and hunter education programs.Idaho Fish and Game Director Virgil Moore, who is also the president of theAssociation of Fish &amp; Wildlife Agencies states that this will allow Stateagencies to form public-private ventures to enhance public access, so aprivately-owned shooting range could qualify for a grant if its proposal metcertain public-access criteria.“As I review budget requests, I’m looking for bang for my buck,” Moore said,noting grant applications are more likely to receive IDFG approval if theyinvolve coalitions offering multiple benefits.Status  info “”It’s been in the House Subcommittee since March 2017 although S. 593 appears to be an identical bill currently before the Senate.HR 2591 - The Modernizing The Pittman-Robertson Fund For Tomorrow’s Needs Act of 2017Sponsored by Rep. Austin Scott, R-Georgia, this legislation would authorize P-Rfunds to recruit, retain, and reactivate hunters and recreational shooters.Jeff Crane, President of the Congressional Sportsmen’sCaucus said P-R fundswould complement marketing campaigns by the National Rifle Association(NRA) and the National Shooting Sports Foundation(NSSF). “They have good programs and want to capitalizeon this,” he said.Allocating P-R funds for marketing is fine if money for wildlife restorationremains intact, said Mike Leahy, senior manager of public lands conservation andsportsmen policy at the National WildlifeFederation.“We think those ought to start small, by redirecting some money from huntereducation to marketing, until we know more about how effective these ideas are,how much they cost, and how great the need is. Let’s see what the return oninvestment is before we start pulling money from wildlife biologists and habitatmanagers.” Leahy said.Status  info “”It was introduced to the House and the House Natural Resources Committee on 05/22/2017. On 09/12/2018 it was passed/agreed to in House. On 09/17/2018 it was received in the Senate and read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.HR 4647 - The Recovering America’s Wildlife ActSponsored by Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Nebraska, this would redirect $1.3 billionin existing royalties and fees annually from drilling and mining on federallands and waters to conserve “the full array of fish and wildlife.” It’salso been in the House Natural Resources Committee since February.The bill would “intermingle” P-R funds with, potentially, $1.3 billion earmarkedto “provide more money for species that don’t have stable funding,” Idaho’s Fishand Game Director Virgil Moore said.This will indirectly benefit hunters who ideally want P-R allocations dedicatedto game animals, Mike Leahy said, because habitat is habitat. HR 4647 “wouldgive states the money they need for wildlife” using little P-R money, he said.This potentially will impact hunters because a non-game animal can still bedesignated endangered — such as the timber rattler in New York’s HudsonHighlands — thereby imposing restrictions on hunting lands.HR 4647’s goal is to “keep species from becoming endangered” and avoid accessrestrictions, Nick Wiley, chief conservation officer for DucksUnlimited, and former executive director of the FloridaFish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said. “Restricting access is rarely agood thing. It’s all about the habitat.”Status  info “”It was introduced to the House on 12/14/2017 and on 02/15/2018 Subcommittee Hearings were held by the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands.Concluding ThoughtsConservation can often be challenging as there will never be enough funding tocover all the needs. Yet, we can (and must) do more to conserve fish, wildlifeand their habitat to ensure the future of hunting, fishing, and outdoorrecreational activities for subsequent generations.Additional Information  note “”fusion94.org is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.I began this article with a quote from Theodore Roosevelt Jr. TR was an Americanstatesman, conservationist and writer who served as the 26th president ofthe United States from 1901 to 1909. He previously served as the 25th vicepresident of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rdgovernor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Partyduring this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in theUnited States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore,alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Inpolls of historians and political scientists, Roosevelt is generally ranked asone of the five best presidents.Roosevelt brought his desire to address the common interests of citizens to theWest. He successfully led efforts to organize ranchers to address problems ofovergrazing and other shared concerns; his work resulted in the formation of theLittle Missouri Stockmen’s Association. He felt compelled to promoteconservation and was able to form the Boone and CrockettClub, whose primary goal was the conservationof large game animals and their habitats.If you’re interested in learning more about Teddy Roosevelt and his views onConservation and Hunting I would recommend the following books:  Hunting Trips of a Ranchman  Ranch Life and the Hunting-Trail  The Wilderness HunterAlso to note is that the Kindle versions of these 3 books are all priced at $0.99Additional Data Points/ChartsThis interactive chart shows the trend of total Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937 with the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 apportionment in 2018 broken down by state.(Data via USFWS)This interactive chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1939 to 2018.(Data via USFWS)The next series of charts has the P-R data broken down in 10 year increments.This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1939 to 1948.(Data via USFWS)This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1949 to 1958.(Data via USFWS)This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1959 to 1968.(Data via USFWS)This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1969 to 1978.(Data via USFWS)This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1979 to 1988.(Data via USFWS)This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1989 to 1998.(Data via USFWS)This chart shows the trend of total P-R apportionment per fiscal year, from 1999 to 2008.(Data via USFWS)Footnotes            Secretary Zinke Announces More Than $1.1 Billion for Sportsmen &amp; Conservation &#8617;              Paying to Play in the Great Outdoors &#8617;      ",

      "content"  : "  Conservation viewed in its entirety, is the slow and laborious unfolding of anew relationship between people and land.  Aldo LeopoldA vote by the U.S. Senate on Tuesday supported a massive package of conservationand public access bills that permanently reauthorizes the Land and WaterConservation Fund and advances other key measures, edging hunters, anglers andother outdoor enthusiasts closer to a hard-won and long-awaited victory.This is the most sweeping conservation leglislation in over a decade, protectingmillions of acres of land and hundreds of miles of wild rivers.The Natural Resources Management Act (S. 47)1 encompasses the consensuspriorities of sportsmen and women as well as a bipartisan cadre of senators whohave worked to ensure the legislation’s survival. Senate Majority Leader MitchMcConnell’s (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) and Sen. LisaMurkowski’s (R-AK) ongoing efforts that began last Congress paid off withtoday’s overwhelming 92-82 vote in support of the measure.to note: this is probably the only time I’ll ever quote Mitch McConnell  “It touches every state, features the input of a wide coalition of ourcolleagues, and has earned the support of a broad, diverse coalition of manyadvocates for public lands, economic development and conservation,” saidSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).Key features of S. 47 include:  Permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund with 3percent dedicated to securing hunting and fishing access opportunities onpublic lands and waters.  Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area.  Methow Valley permanent mineral withdrawal.  California Desert Protection and Recreation Act.  Cerro del Yuta and Rio San Antonio wilderness areas.  Reauthorization of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Partners for Fish andWildlife program at current funding levels of $51.6 million until FY2022.  Reauthorization of Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act at $6.5 million  until FY2022, a $2.6 million increase of funding from currently enacted  levels.  Authorization for hunters with archery equipment to cross National ParkService lands by foot or horseback.Voting BreakdownAs mentioned earlier the voting was 92-8 with the 8 NAYs coming from RepublicanSenators.Left to DoOne thing to note is that this is only a partial win at the moment as there isstill the need for the House of Representatives to quickly vote on S. 47where it can the be passed on to the president’s desk for signature. At thatpoint it will become law.How to ActIf this is important to you here’s how to act.  Locate your RepresentativeMany people don’t know who their senators and representatives are. And that’sokay! You can go here and inputyour zip code or state; it will tell you who your elected officials are. Onceyou have the names, you can find their contact informationhere.  Once you’ve located your Representative you can either email or call them asking for them to support the bill. A sample email is listed below.  info “”Subject: Please Support S. 47  Dear [[Recipient’s Title and Name]]:  I strongly urge you to consider Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Maria Cantwell’s (D-WA) public lands package (S. 47) on the House floor.The Senate Energy and Natural Resources and House Natural Resources committees and many others worked around the clock last Congress to develop a bipartisan public lands package that includes the following:      Permanently reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund with 3 percent dedicated to securing access opportunities for hunters and anglers;    Implementation of the Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area Designation Act;    Permanent mineral withdrawal in Methow Valley, Washington;    The bipartisan collaboration of the California Desert Protection and Recreation Act;    Reauthorization of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife program at current funding levels until FY2022;    Reauthorization of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act at $6.5 million until FY2022;    Designation of Cerro Del Yuta and Rio San Antonio as wilderness areas.    Now is the time for you to uphold leadership’s commitment to pass this meaningful, bipartisan legislation as a top priority during the 116th Congress. Sportsmen and women like me depend on you to conserve our wild public lands, waters and wildlife.

      "content"  : "  “We need all citizens to care, we need all citizens to believe, we need all citizens to engage, and we need to again make it understood that to be concerned about conservation is an act of citizenship.”  – Shane MahoneyI believe that this can be a challenging topic to discuss at times depending on one’s viewpoint. In this post I will try and walk you through various types of Conservation as it can have many different meanings.Let’s start by defining Conservation at it’s very base level:  info “”Conservation may refer to the preservation or efficient use of resources (in an efficient or ethical manner), or the conservation of various quantities under physical laws.To be clear, the terms conservation and preservation are frequently thought of as one and the same. This is not necessarily the case. The US National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:  info “”Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference. Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources, while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings, objects, and landscapes. Put simply, conservation seeks the proper use of nature, while preservation seeks protection of nature from use.In laymans terms, Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether1.There are many subtopics of Conservation and there are many sub-subtopics as well.Conservation of biodiversity, environment, and natural resources  Conservation biology, the science of protection and management of biodiversity  Conservation (ethic), an ethic of use, protection, and management of the environment and natural resources  Conservation organization an organization dedicated to protection and management of the environment or natural resources  Conservationist (Conservation movement), a person who advocates for conservation of the environment and natural resources  Conservation of Natural Resources:          Habitat conservation, land management practices to protect, manage, and restore habitat      Wetland conservation, management to protect and restore wetlands      Wildlife conservation, protection of endangered species and their habitat                  Wildlife management, management to conserve wild species and their habitats                    In this series I’ll be primarily covering the subtopic of Conservation of Natural Resources and what that entails.Conservation of Natural Resources refers to the sustainable utilization of natural resources, like soils, water, plants, animals, and minerals, timber, fish, game, topsoil, pastureland, and minerals, and also to the preservation of forests-forestry, wildlife-wildlife refuge, parkland, wilderness, and watershed areas.Natural resources are made up of two major types, renewable natural resources and nonrenewable natural resources.Examples of renewable natural resources are wildlife and all forms of natural vegetation. The soil itself can be taken as a renewable resource, even though any serious damage to it is not easily repaired due to the slow rate of soil-forming processes.The natural drainage of waters from the watershed of an area can be sustained indefinitely through careful management of vegetation and soils, and the quality of water can be regulated through water pollution control.Nonrenewable resources on the other hand are those that cannot be replaced or that can be replaced except after an exceptionally long periods of time. Examples of such resources are the fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, and natural gas as well as metallic ores.Natural Resources: Wildlife and Conservation BiologyThe aim of renewable resource conservation is to make certain that resources are not used up faster than they are replaced. Non renewable resources are fossil fuels and mineral deposits, like iron ore and gold ore.Conservation activities for nonrenewable resources center on maintaining a sufficient supply of these resources far into the future.Natural resources are conserved for their biological, economic, and recreational values, in addition to their natural beauty and in some instances it’s relevance to local cultures.Divergences are experienced when natural-resource shortages build up in the face of progressively increasing demands from a growing human population. Disagreement occasionally envelop the way a resource ought to be utilized, or allocated, and for whom.For instance, a river may provide water for agricultural irrigation, habitat for fish, and water-generated electricity for a factory.Farmers, fishers, and industry leaders compete for unlimited right of entry into this river, but a freedom like this may obliterate the resource, and conservation methods are essential to safeguard the river for future use.The competition gets worst when a natural resource extends across political boundaries. For instance, the headwaters, or source of a main river may be situated in a different country than the country through which the river flows.There is no assurance that the river source will be safeguarded to provide accommodation reserve requirements downstream. Additionally, the manner in which a natural resource is handled has a direct effect upon other natural resources.Cutting down a forest close to a river, for an example increases erosion, the wearing away of topsoil, and can result to flooding. Eroded soil and silt cloud the river and has adverse affect on a lot of organisms like fish and essential aquatic plants that need clean, clear freshwater to thrive.Habitat ConservationHabitat conservation is a management practice that seeks to conserve, protect and restore habitat areas for wild plants and animals, especially conservation reliant species, and prevent their extinction, fragmentation or reduction in range2.For much of human history, nature had been seen as a resource, one that could be controlled by the government and used for personal and economic gain. The idea was that plants only existed to feed animals and animals only existed to feed humans.3 The land itself had limited value only extending to the resources it could provide such as minerals and oil.Eventually humans began to appreciate the value of nature itself and the need to protect pristine wilderness.4 By the middle of the 20th century countries such as the United States, Canada, and Britain understood this appreciation and instigated laws and legislation in order to ensure that the most fragile and beautiful environments would be protected for generations to come.Habitat conservation is important in maintaining biodiversity, an essential part of global food security.Habitat conservation is vital for protecting species and ecological processes. It is important to conserve and protect the space/ area in which that species occupies. Therefore, areas classified as ‘biodiversity hotspots’, or those in which a flagship, umbrella, or endangered species inhabits are often the habitats that are given precedence over others.Species that possess an elevated risk of extinction are given the highest priority and as a result of conserving their habitat, other species in that community are protected thus serving as an element of gap analysis. In the United States of America, a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is often developed to conserve the environment in which a specific species inhabits. Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) the habitat that requires protection in an HCP is referred to as the ‘critical habitat’.Wetland ConservationWetland conservation is aimed at protecting and preserving areas where water exists at or near the Earth’s surface, such as swamps, marshes and bogs. Wetlands cover at least six per cent of the Earth and have become a focal issue for conservation due to the ecosystem services they provide. More than three billion people, around half the world’s population, obtain their basic water needs from inland freshwater wetlands.The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, also known as the Ramsar Convention, defines wetlands as including: lakes and rivers, swamps and marshes, wet grasslands and peatlands, oases, estuaries, deltas and tidal flats, near-shore marine areas, mangroves and coral reefs, and human-made sites such as fish ponds, rice paddies, reservoirs, and salt pans.Wetlands vary widely in their salinity levels, climatic zones, supported flora, surrounding geography, whether they are coastal or inland and so on.The main functions performed by wetlands are: water filtration, water storage, biological productivity, and provide habitat for wildlife.Wildlife ConservationWildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitat. Wildlife plays an important role in balancing the ecosystem and provides stability to different natural processes of nature like rainfall, changing of temperature, fertility of soil. The goal of wildlife conservation is to ensure that nature will be around for future generations to enjoy and also to recognize the importance of wildlife and wilderness for humans and other species alike.Wildlife conservation has become an increasingly important practice due to the negative effects of human activity on wildlife. An endangered species is defined as a population of a living species that is in the danger of becoming extinct because the species has a very low or falling population, or because they are threatened by the varying environmental or prepositional parameters.Fewer natural wildlife habitat areas remain each year. Moreover, the habitat that remains has often been degraded to bear little resemblance to the wild areas which existed in the past. Habitat loss due to destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat is the primary threat to the survival of wildlife.Here’s a list of various other factors impacting this issue:  Climate Change  Unregulated Hunting and Poaching  Pollution  Overexploitation  Deforestation  Population  CullingAccording to the National Wildlife Federation, wildlife conservation in the United States gets a majority of its funding through appropriations from the federal budget, annual federal and state grants, and financial efforts from programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program5.Furthermore, a substantial amount of funding comes from the state through the sale of hunting/fishing licenses, game tags, stamps, and excise taxes from the purchase of hunting equipment and ammunition.Concluding ThoughtsIn conclusion I hope that you better understand the difference between Conservation and Preservation. In the next part of the series I will be covering some of the most important legislation passed in the United States since the early 20th century including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act of 1934, and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950.Additional Information  note “”fusion94.org is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.If you’re interested in learning more about Conservation I do recommend the following books:  Natural Acts: A Sidelong View of Science and Nature  Artic Dreams  Encounters with the Archdruid: Narratives About a Conservationist and Three of His Natural Enemies  All The Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner, and the American WestAdditionally you might find the Conversation Matters Podcast very interesting.  info “”Shane Mahoney, a Newfoundland Native is the President and CEO of Conservation Visions Inc.

C - Control the muzzle direction at all times.  T - Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger until you are ready tofire.  S - See that the firearm is unloaded and PROVE that it is safe.  P - Point your firearm down range (or in the safest possible direction).  R - Remove all cartridges.  O - Observe the chamber(s) or cylinder.  V - Verify the action or feeding path.  E - Examine the bore.Also to note are the rules of Jeff Cooper, an influential figure in modernfirearms training, formalized and popularized “Four Rules” of safe firearmhandling.  All guns are always loaded.  Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.  Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target.

Home Controller or Hub  Sensors  Actuators  InterfacesHome ControllerWe can think of the controller as the brain of the system. It is the tool thatbasically holds everything together. The controller is the headquarters of theAutomated Home. It communicates with other devices to get information anddirects the to do things like “turn on the lights”.SensorsGenerally they are the remote correspondents of the controller placed throughoutthe house. They can gather information such as temperature, humidity and lightlevel and send that information back to the controller. With the controller nowhaving this information the controller can make decisions based on automationrules that we have configured.ActuatorsActuators are the devices that can take an action and carry out tasks based onour automation rules as well as the information transmitted from the sensors.InterfacesInterfaces are nothing more than how we interact with the controller. It can bea mobile or web interface or even a device such as GoogleHome or the AmazonAlexa.My SetupI decided to start with the basics back then and set everything up using thefollowing devices:  Google Chromecast  Philips Hue Bridge  Nest Cameras  Nest Thermostat  Nest Protect  WeMo Smart SwitchYou can find my setup over onGitHubI will be writing longer posts over the next few weeks going into greaterdetails as it pertains to my setup.",

Open a terminal (Launchpad -&gt; Terminal).  Type the following command:  sudo killall VDCAssistant  Re-open your application. You should see that the camera is working now.The reason for this is due to the fact that Mac OS X launches a backgroundprocess called VDCAssistant when an application that requires the camera islaunched. When this background process is not closed properly when theapplication is closed, it will hog up the resources and prevent other apps fromaccessing the camera. By force closing this background process, you are freeingup the resources to make the camera available again for applications.This should fix the “No Camera Available” issue 99% of the time. For theremaining times, you are probably better of restarting your Mac.",

      "content"  : "This is just a quick tutorial on how to setup and configure the Automatic BedLeveling system in Simplify3D for the FlashForge Creator Pro 3D Printer.To automatically position the extruder to various points on the build platformfor leveling, select “Tools &gt; Bed Leveling Wizard” from the top menu.Select “Manually enter leveling positions” and add the following positions:  X:75, Y:130 (back left screw position)  X:180, Y:130 (back right screw position)  X:130, Y:0 (front center screw position)  X:130, Y:67.5 (center of build platform)When you’ve added these coordinates you will end up with something that looks alot like this:Now you can begin leveling the bed. Make sure you have the “Special Sheet forBuild Plate Leveling” that came with your FFCP. If you no longer have that youcan use a 0.10 mm (0.004”) feeler gauge (or sheet of letter sized paper).Hit the button “Begin Leveling”. At first the extruder will move to a couple ofextreme points. Once that has completed hit the “Next button” and the extruderwill move to the coordinates entered about for the back left screw position.Slide your leveling sheet (or feeler gauge) under the extruders. Turning thenuts on the bottom of the table CW (clockwise) makes the gap bigger (lessresistance). CCW (counter-clockwise) makes the gap smaller (greater resistance).Turn the nut until your leveling sheet meets with a little resistance.Now hit the “Next” button again and the extruder will move to the next set ofcoordinates (should be back right screw position). Complete the process ofadjustment again and then repeat for the remaining 2 leveling positions.You should now have your bed leveled properly which will limit adhesionproblems and possible failures.",

      "content"  : "About six weeks ago I decided to pickup a new 3d Printer. After looking at whatwas out there from MakerBot, Ultimaker, Type A Machines, Chinese knockoffs (likeFlashForge and Wanhao) and the various models based off the RepRap Prusa, Ifinally settled on the FlashForge Creator Pro Dual Extrusion 3D Printer (FFCP).Some of the reasons I chose the FFCP is because it’s totally enclosed. Thisshould allow for more efficient and higher quality ABS prints. It has athree-point platform leveling system which is pretty intuitive. It has a heatresistant build platform support made of highly-durable metal. And has athicker Z-axis rod which provides for steadier and precise movement.Key features and improvements:  Sturdy metal frame is substantially more stable than the Creator’s original wood frame.  Warp-resistant 6.3mm aluminum build platform remains perfectly level under the stress of high heat.  Heat-resistant metal platform supports replace plastic supports.  Heavy-duty (10mm) z-axis guide rod ensures steady and precise movement.  Acrylic cover encloses the chamber to insulate and protect ABS prints.  LED light illuminates the build chamber.  Integrated LCD screen and button board functions error-free.Out of the box it required very minimal setup. Here are the steps:  Set the power supply to use 115V (ships set to 230V).  Attach dual extruders to extruder seat using 2 hex screws (provided).  Attach filament spool holders.  Attach filament guide tube.  Plug in power cord.  Plug in USB cable type A/B.  Install flament onto filament spool holders.At this point you should have something that looks a lot like this:I’m not going to go into the details for assembeling the top enclosure as it’spretty self-explanatory. Once you’ve gotten that assembled and in place alongwith the front door you will have something that looks like this:In the next few days I’ll be writing additional blog posts related to the FFCPso stay tuned.",

I needed to figure out how to do this sothat I could update my blog from both my personal desktop and my laptop.Note: This solution will only work with the 2.x version of Octopress. Forthe 3.x version there’s OctopressDeployHow Octopress WorksOctopress repositories have two branches, source and master. The sourcebranch contains the files that are used to generate the blog and the mastercontains the blog itself.When the local folders are initially configured according to the Octopress SetupGuide, the master branch is stored in a subfolder named _deploy. Since thefolder name begins with an underscore, it is ignored when you git push origin source.

      "content"  : "Blizzard’s latest game, Hearthstone: Heroes ofWarcraft entered open beta on January21st, 2014, opening it all for all Mac and PC users in North America.Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is currently a free-to-play collectible cardgame that revolves around turn-based online 1v1 matches between two opponents.Hearthstone is set within the Warcraft universe, with the majority of itscharacters and cards drawing from existing lore.MatchesEach Hearthstone battle is a 1vs1 match between two opponents. Gameplay inHearthstone is turn-based, with players taking turns to play cards from theirhand, casting spells, equipping weapons, or summoning ‘minions’ to do battle ontheir behalf. Play may be between two human players, or one player and acomputer-controlled opponent.Each player is represented by their chosen ‘hero’, an important character fromWarcraft lore. Each hero represents a particular class, determining the specialcards and unique hero power available to them. Each hero has 30 Health - if thatnumber is reduced to zero, the hero is destroyed, and the controlling player haslost the game. The available heroes and classes are:  Mage (Jaina Proudmoore)  Priest (Anduin Wrynn)  Warlock (Gul’dan)  Paladin (Uther the Lightbringer)  Warrior (Garrosh Hellscream)  Druid (Malfurion Stormrage)  Hunter (Rexxar)  Rogue (Valeera Sanguinar)  Shaman (Thrall)At the start of each turn, the player draws a new card from their deck - acollection of 30 cards selected before battle. Players can choose to play usingone of several pre-assembled ‘basic’ decks, or one of their own custom-madedecks. While most cards are available to heroes of any class, a substantialportion are limited to a specific class, giving each hero their own strengthsand unique possibilities.During their turn, each player can choose to play any of their cards, use theirhero power, command their minions to attack targets, or attack directly usingtheir hero, if they have a weapon equipped. However, which actions the player isable to take is partly determined by their mana. Each player starts the gamewith 1 mana crystal, and gains one more at the start of each turn, until themaximum of 10 is reached. Each card and hero power requires the player to expenda specific amount of mana in order to play it, strategically limiting eachplayer’s actions. In addition, the larger mana pools in later rounds allowplayers to play increasingly expensive cards, opening the game up to ever moreimpressive moves and powerful abilities.A match is concluded when one or both players has reached zero health, orchooses to concede. Completing a battle will grant each player hero experience(winning earns additional experience) and granting them access to additionalcards up to level 10 or golden versions of basic cards past level 10.Each match takes place on a randomly selected battlefield, representing theboard on which the game is played. There are currently four possiblebattlefields: Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Pandaria and Stranglethorn. Each battlefieldfeatures its own design and numerous interactive elements, but gameplay is in noway affected or determined by battlefield selection.CardsCards are the main substance of Hearthstone, representing the abilities,characters and effects which each player is able to make use of during thematch. There are currently 382 cards in the game, with more planned to be addedto the game later through the introduction of expansion packs and ‘adventures’.In all game modes except Arena, the player does battle using a deck of 30 cards,constructed from cards in the player’s collection. Each deck can only featuretwo of each card, and only one of each legendary card. Arena play features nosuch limitations, but requires players to play using a new deck chosen from aseries of randomly provided selections. For either type of deck, theconstruction of a player’s deck is a key strategic element in the game,determining which cards are available to them during the course of a match.Each player starts the game with a wide selection of basic cards. Cards ofhigher rarity can be obtained by purchasing card packs, or as rewards from Arenamode. Card packs and entry to the Arena can be purchased using real money, orgold, an in-game currency earned through completing special ‘quests’, such aswinning a certain number of matches, or dealing a certain amount of damage. Eachcard pack consists of five random cards, including at least one rare card.Obtaining new cards allows the player to add them to their decks, opening up newpossibilities for play and strategy.Players can also use the crafting system to create new cards. The system usesarcane dust to craft specific cards. Arcane dust can be obtained as an Arenareward, or by destroying existing cards, allowing players to convert unwantedcards into more desirable options. The crafting system was created as analternative to the player card trading prevalent in trading card games such asMagic: The Gathering, with no plans for cards to be traded between players.Similar to the foils found in physical collectible card games, Hearthstonefeatures golden cards, special versions of regular cards featuring a goldenborder and unique animations. These cards are far harder to obtain than theirregular versions, and cost more arcane dust to craft. Golden cards differ fromtheir regular counterparts purely cosmetically, and are designed to allowplayers to show off their accomplishments.Game ModesFour main game modes are available to play in Hearthstone.  In Practice mode, players can play against a selection of computer opponents. Players can learn the basics of the game battling against ‘basic’ opponents, or can put their skills to the test against improved ‘expert’ opponents.  Play mode matches players against other human players of similar skill, in random matches. Players can choose to play Casual ‘friendly’ games, or take part in Ranked play, earning special medals to reflect their skill and standing within the community. Ranked play features a 26-tier rank system, with wins allowing the player to progress to higher ranks, and losses causing them to descend in rank. The highest rank is called Legend. This rank cannot be lost until the season ends and the rank features the exact ranking in your region. All ranks are reset at the end of each season, with each season lasting for about one month. Ranked play is also planned to provide special cosmetic rewards for participation, such as golden heroes and alternative card backs.  Arena mode, which costs in-game gold or real money to play, has the player drafting a deck by choosing between 3 cards until they have picked 30. Players then use their drafted deck to do battle in a series of games against other Arena players. Each Arena run lasts until the player has reached three losses or twelve wins, or chooses to retire their deck, at which point they are granted a number of rewards determined by the total number of games won. While constructed decks have card restrictions, Arena decks have no such card limits.  Duels allow players to challenge players on their friends list to unranked matches. Duels offer no rewards, but allow players to play games outside of the other game modes.The game also features a Tutorial, a limited and non-repeatable startingexperience designed to introduce players to Hearthstone, in which the player ispitched against a series of special opponents, with substantial dialogueelements.SummaryOverall I think Hearthstone has been done really well and I’m enjoying my timethere. My understanding is that the game will always be free to play but thatBlizzard will charge for card packs. I also know that they are planning torelease game clients for Hearthstone for iPhone, iPad and Android sometime afterthe official launch.If you’re so inclined feel free to download the game and friend me using mygamertag of fusion94#1276",
